Here comes the elephant, big and gray,  
With floppy ears that sway all day.  
He trumpets loud and stomps his feet,  
But loves his peanuts for a treat.  
He splashes water with his trunk,  
Then gives a giggle, "What a hunk!"

Next is the monkey, swinging high,  
From tree to tree, he loves to fly.  
He peels a banana with such grace,  
And makes a silly monkey face.  
He chatters, laughs, and jumps around,  
The silliest friend you'll have around.

The penguin waddles to the front,  
With his tuxedo, on a hunt.  
He slides on ice with belly wide,  
Then dives into the water‚Äôs tide.  
He loves the cold, the snow, the freeze,  
And swims with fish beneath the seas.

Here comes the giraffe, so tall and lean,  
The tallest creature you've ever seen.  
Her neck reaches high into the trees,  
Nibbling leaves with the greatest ease.  
She strolls along, her head held high,  
A gentle giant in the sky.

The hippo‚Äôs next, so big and round,  
She splashes water all around.  
With a great big yawn, she opens wide,  
But she's a softie deep inside.  
She loves to swim and soak all day,  
In her muddy, cozy bay.

Now here‚Äôs the tiger, orange and black,  
With stripes that run across his back.  
He prowls through jungles, sleek and fast,  
But loves a nap when the day has passed.  
He may look fierce, with a mighty roar,  
But deep down, he‚Äôs a cuddle core.

Next comes the koala, soft and sweet,  
With eucalyptus leaves to eat.  
She climbs so slowly, with great care,  
And naps all day without a care.  
Her fluffy ears and button nose,  
Make her cuter than she knows.

The dolphin jumps high in the sea,  
With a joyful squeak, so wild and free.  
She flips and twirls, a graceful sight,  
Dancing in the ocean‚Äôs light.  
She loves to splash and play in waves,  
In deep blue water where she braves.

The kangaroo hops with a bound,  
Carrying her joey all around.  
She bounces fast, from here to there,  
With her little one tucked with care.  
Together they leap, they bounce, they spring,  
A duo full of joy and zing.

The owl, so wise, with eyes so bright,  
Flies silently in the moonlit night.  
He hoots a tune from up on high,  
As stars twinkle in the sky.  
With feathers soft and wings so wide,  
He watches over the countryside.

The bear comes lumbering, big and bold,  
With a coat of fur that fights the cold.  
He munches berries, honey too,  
Then hibernates when winter‚Äôs due.  
He snoozes long through snow and ice,  
Dreaming of spring‚Äôs warm paradise.

The squirrel darts from tree to tree,  
Gathering nuts with glee, glee, glee.  
He scurries fast, his tail held high,  
As autumn leaves begin to fly.  
He‚Äôs quick, he‚Äôs clever, sharp and spry,  
With a stash of acorns piled high.

The parrot squawks in colors bright,  
With feathers shining in the light.  
He mimics words with such delight,  
And loves to sing with all his might.  
He flutters here, he flutters there,  
A rainbow bird, beyond compare.

The turtle crawls with steady pace,  
A little grin upon his face.  
He carries home upon his back,  
And never feels he‚Äôs out of whack.  
Slow and steady, calm and true,  
The turtle knows just what to do.

The fox is sly with a bushy tail,  
He sneaks through forests without fail.  
With clever eyes and paws so quick,  
He disappears with every trick.  
But when he rests beneath the trees,  
He dreams of chasing gentle breeze.

The peacock struts with feathers wide,  
A burst of color in every stride.  
He fans his tail, so proud and bright,  
A walking rainbow, pure delight.  
With every step, he knows he‚Äôs grand,  
The most majestic in the land.

The cow goes ‚Äúmoo‚Äù in the grassy field,  
Her love for grass is never sealed.  
She chews her cud beneath the sky,  
And swishes flies as they buzz by.  
With big brown eyes and gentle ways,  
She brightens up her farmer‚Äôs days.

The rabbit hops with fluffy feet,  
Nibbling carrots, oh so sweet.  
He twitches whiskers, twitches nose,  
And leaps around wherever he goes.  
With every hop, he‚Äôs full of cheer,  
A fuzzy friend who‚Äôs always near.

So many animals, wild and free,  
Each with their own personality.  
From jungle deep to ocean blue,  
They share their world with me and you.  
In every creature, big or small,  
There‚Äôs something special in them all!
