			<pre>
This little piggy went to the market,  
And found himself in a meaty target.  
He traded his coins for apples and spice,  
But soon became sausage—how very nice!  
Now sizzling away in a breakfast pan,  
This piggy’s tale ended with a grand slam.  

This little piggy stayed home,  
Safe from the market, she chose to roam.  
But a farmer appeared with a twinkle and grin,  
Said, "Bacon it is!" and rubbed his chin.  
Now she’s crisp and golden, a breakfast delight,  
Served with eggs in the morning light.  

This little piggy had roast beef,  
But greed was his downfall—oh, what grief!  
He ate and he feasted, his belly grew wide,  
Until they decided on ham for his hide.  
Now he’s spiral-cut, with a honey glaze,  
A holiday feast for the rest of his days.  

This little piggy had none,  
But his empty plate didn’t mean he’d won.  
His skinny frame caught the butcher’s eye,  
And soon he was pork chops, tender and spry.  
Now on the grill, he’s seasoned just right,  
A juicy meal on a summer night.  

And this little piggy cried wee, wee, wee, all the way home!  
He thought he’d escaped, free to roam.  
But his running made him slippery and hard,  
Until they turned him straight into lard.  
Now he’s in cookies, pies, and bread—  
His legacy lives on, though he’s long been fed.
