			<pre>
When I am cold, and the frost bites my skin,  
When warmth feels so far, and the dark closes in,  
Will you be the fire to banish the freeze?  
When I am cold, will you put me at ease?  

When I am hot, and the sun burns too bright,  
When I’m scorched by the glare and yearn for the night,  
Will you be the shade that cools my despair?  
When I am hot, will you always be there?  

When I am sick, and the days feel so long,  
When weakness takes over, and I’m no longer strong,  
Will you stay by my side through the aches and the pain?  
When I am sick, will you help me regain?  

When I am lost, and I can’t find my way,  
When the world feels so vast, and my hope goes astray,  
Will you be my guide through the twists and the turns?  
When I am lost, will you help me discern?  

When I am tired, and my will starts to break,  
When the weight of the world is too much to take,  
Will you carry me through with your steadfast hand?  
When I am tired, will you help me to stand?  

When I am hurt, and my heart feels so sore,  
When tears fall like rain, and I can’t take much more,  
Will you mend my wounds with the love that we share?  
When I am hurt, will you always be there?  

When I am happy, and the laughter runs free,  
When joy fills the air like waves on the sea,  
Will you share in my light and let it shine through?  
When I am happy, will you smile with me too?  

Through cold, heat, and sorrow, through joy and despair,  
Our friendship’s a bond that’s beyond all compare.  
Will you stand by my side, no matter the test?  
When I am in need, you’re the one I love best.
