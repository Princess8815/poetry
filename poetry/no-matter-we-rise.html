				<pre>
No matter how they pass their cruel decree,
To cleanse the world of folks like you and me,
No matter if they burn the flags we've flown,
Or say we‚Äôre wrong for simply being known,
No matter if they spit or curse our way,
We live, we breathe, and still we will not sway.

They push, but we refuse to shrink or break,
We love with fire they cannot unmake.
We find each other in the harshest night,
And still our colors blaze in morning light.
No matter what they legislate or say‚Äî
We lift our chins and know we'll be okay.

No matter if they drag us into doubt,
Or claim the world would be more pure without.
No matter prayers they weaponize in vain,
To damn our joy and justify our pain.
No matter tombs they try to carve today,
They cannot kill the truth we proudly say.

We dance in streets where silence once held reign,
We bloom from concrete, beautiful and plain.
Each kiss we claim becomes a vow to stay,
To carve our future in our fiercest way.
We are the storm that does not drift or sway‚Äî
We hold our ground and know we'll be okay.

No matter if the stares grow sharp like blades,
Or friends fall quiet as our comfort fades.
No matter when the closet claws again,
Or strangers sneer as if our joy‚Äôs a sin.
No matter how the world pretends we‚Äôre less,
We wear our scars like medals nonetheless.

We walk through fire and call it by our name,
And laugh as ash still cannot dim our flame.
We teach our hearts to shout what others hide,
We stitch our souls from places they denied.
The night is long, but we will find our way‚Äî
Together, always, we will be okay.

No matter how the mirror casts its spell,
Or sings the lies we‚Äôve taught ourselves too well.
No matter how our hands have learned to shake,
Or how we hide the pieces others break.
No matter dreams we buried out of fear,
We rise from places they don‚Äôt dare come near.

We are the fire that silence could not drown,
The ones who bent but never laid hearts down.
Our names are carved in stone the world can‚Äôt take,
Our truth too loud, too bright for them to fake.
We were not built to yield or slip away‚Äî
We write our names and scream we‚Äôre here to stay.

No matter how they twist and mock our pride,
Or chase us from the homes for which we cried.
No matter walls they build to block our breath,
Or cages meant to sentence us to death.
No matter how they beg the sky to fall,
We are still here, and we have heard the call.

We are the echoes bursting from the chains,
We are the flowers growing through remains.
We speak in thunder, born from muted years,
We turned their hate into our battle cheers.
They built a world to cast our love away‚Äî
But we survived, and we will be okay.

No matter how they write our story‚Äôs end,
Or break us just to try and make us bend.
No matter if the world forgets our names,
Or tries to douse our slow, defiant flames.
No matter how they turn our lives to fights,
We carry on and blaze through darkest nights.

We are the ones who kissed beneath their wrath,
Who danced and dared and made our own damn path.
We stitched the stars from all the times we bled,
And made a song of every tear we shed.
This is our vow, no matter what they say‚Äî
We will be us. And we will be okay.
