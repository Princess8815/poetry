			<pre>
Grief is a shadow that darkens the day,
A storm in the heart that won't drift away.
Its weight is a boulder, pressing us low,
A tide that keeps pulling wherever we go.

It starts with a whisper, then grows to a roar,
A pain that we feel in our very core.
Memories linger like ghosts in the night,
Flickering softly, then blinding with light.

We ask all the questions, but answers won't come,
The silence around us feels deafening, numb.
Why did this happen? What could we do?
The world feels much colder, a bleaker hue.

Tears fall like rain, unbidden, untamed,
A torrent of feelings too wild to be named.
But grief is the proof of the love that we shared,
A testament showing how deeply we cared.

Though heavy the burden, it‚Äôs not ours alone,
Others have walked through this valley unknown.
We lean on their shoulders, find strength in their hands,
Together, we rise like the soft, shifting sands.

Time doesn‚Äôt heal, but it tempers the sting,
Teaching the heart how to mend broken wings.
The love that we lost doesn‚Äôt fade but transforms,
Filling the cracks left by life‚Äôs raging storms.

We honor their memory, not by despair,
But by living a life with kindness and care.
Their echoes inspire us to reach for the skies,
To give of ourselves and let our spirits rise.

Grief is a teacher, though harsh and unkind,
It shapes who we are, in body and mind.
It whispers of endings, yet shows us the way,
To cherish each moment, each fleeting day.

So though it may linger, we learn how to cope,
Through moments of darkness, we kindle new hope.
For after the storm, the sun always appears,
And joy softly rises to conquer the tears.

The journey is long, the road often steep,
But through it, we find what‚Äôs worth trying to keep.
Grief is a chapter, not the whole tale,
A challenge that proves our hearts can prevail.

So when you are drowning, lost in the wave,
Remember the strength of the love that they gave.
Their light is still with you, though hidden from view,
A beacon of hope to guide you through.

Let each day remind you: you‚Äôre never alone,
Your grief is a garden where resilience is grown.
And though it feels endless, this sorrowful sea,
It shapes you, it molds you, and sets your soul free.
