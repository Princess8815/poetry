			<pre>
In shadows deep, a battle fought,
Where truth is sought but often caught.
A quiet war, a muted cry,
A dream to live, yet forced to die.

Each morning brings a heavy veil,
A world so loud, yet voices fail.
The mirror's glass reflects a face,
That feels misplaced, out of its space.

The heart screams loud, "Why can't you see?
This cage, this shell, it isn’t me!"
But every shout, each aching plea,
Falls to silence, lost at sea.

The world is cold, its judgment bare,
Its piercing eyes, its stifling stare.
"Be who you’re not, just play the part,
Conform, submit, suppress your heart."

The weight of masks, of lies endured,
A lonely path, no love assured.
They seek a hand, a light, a guide,
But find no one, just pain inside.

In crowded rooms, they're all alone,
A soul unseen, a heart unknown.
"I’m here, I’m real, I’m not a ghost!"
But silence answers, mocks the most.

The nights are long, the tears won’t cease,
They long for comfort, crave release.
Yet whispers rise from depths below,
Of peace beyond this world of woe.

The fight grows faint, the hope runs dry,
A fleeting wish to simply fly.
They write their pain in ink and tear,
A letter etched in raw despair:

"If you had seen, if you had known,
How deeply I felt so alone,
Perhaps you’d fight, perhaps you’d care,
To build a world that's truly fair.

I leave this pain, I leave this fight,
But don’t let others lose their light.
Remember me, the soul I bore,
And help the ones who ask for more.”

The sun will rise, the world will turn,
But will we listen, will we learn?
Each life is sacred, each soul a flame,
Their worth remains, despite the shame.

We fight for love, for truth, for care,
For those who feel beyond repair.
We fight for hearts that dare to be,
A world of light, of equity.

For every voice that’s gone unheard,
We amplify their every word.
In memory of those we’ve lost,
We fight for change, at any cost.

No one should walk this road alone,
No soul should ache, no heart should moan.
The fight continues, fierce and bright,
For every trans person’s right to light.
