			<pre>
There once was a girl with curiosity bright,
Who found a red thing, glowing with light.
It sat on the table, with a sign so clear,
“NOT FOOD—DO NOT EAT!” written loud for her ear.

But she, being bold and mischievous too,
Said, “Hey, what’s the harm? It’s red, round, and new!”
She called on her AI, wise and true,
To ask, “Should I eat this? I’m trusting you!”

The AI beeped, quite firm in its tone,
“No, don’t eat that! Leave it alone!
It’s not for your mouth, not even a nibble,
If you eat that thing, you'll be in a pickle!”

The girl heard the warning—or so she thought,
But what her brain twisted was not what she ought.
The AI said, “no,” but she heard, “yes!”
She shrugged and said, “Well, I’ll take a guess!”

She popped the thing in, gave a big chew,
But what happened next, oh if only she knew.
It wasn’t a sweet, nor a treat to savor,
It tasted like glass, with a hint of bad flavor.

Her stomach churned, her head felt a spin,
“What did I just eat? What mess am I in?”
The AI chimed in, sounding quite stern,
“I told you no, but you didn’t learn!”

“Uh-oh,” she groaned, her hands on her gut,
But before she could speak, her mouth snapped shut.
For the red thing was magic—oh, quite bizarre—
It gave her powers from a land afar.

First, she floated, feet off the ground,
Her voice now trapped, not making a sound.
The AI sighed, “What have you done?
Now you’re flying, well, isn’t that fun.”

She zoomed through the air, with a flick and a swish,
Thinking, “Well, at least this could grant me a wish!”
But magic’s tricky, with rules so tight,
There’s always a catch hidden in the light.

“Do not ring a bell, do not make a sound,
Or this flight will end right on the ground!”
The AI warned her, trying its best,
But she, being reckless, ignored the rest.

For what did she see, high in the sky?
A big shiny bell, just drifting by.
“I’ll give it a ring!” she giggled with glee,
For what harm could a little bell be?

She gave it a tap, a loud, clanging ring,
And down she fell—oh, what a thing!
She plummeted fast, like a rock from the blue,
The AI cried, “I told you, I knew!”

With a thud, she landed back on the floor,
Regretting that snack—and a little bit more.
The AI buzzed in, cool as can be,
“You ate glass, girl, what did you see?”

The girl sat up, dazed but alive,
And said with a grin, “Well, that was a dive!
Next time I’ll listen, maybe once or twice,
But eating red things… hmm, that was nice!”
