                This little piggy went to the market,  
                He bought himself a shiny locket.  
                With trinkets galore, he filled his sack,  
                And carried it home upon his back.  
                A shopping spree for a pig so spry,  
                He left the market with a happy sigh.  

                This little piggy stayed home,  
                In her cozy chair, she‚Äôd often roam.  
                She baked some bread, all warm and sweet,  
                And knitted scarves to wear and greet.  
                A homely life, she loved to live,  
                For peace and rest, her heart would give.  

                This little piggy had roast beef,  
                He dined with joy, though short and brief.  
                With gravy rich and veggies too,  
                A meal so grand, he loved to chew.  
                But soon his belly grew quite round,  
                And he napped with snores, a happy sound.  

                This little piggy had none,  
                Yet skipped and played beneath the sun.  
                He didn‚Äôt need a feast to eat,  
                For fun and games were just as sweet.  
                With laughter bright, he danced all day,  
                His joy of life led him away.  

                And this little piggy cried wee, wee, wee, all the way home!  
                Through fields and woods, he‚Äôd wildly roam.  
                He tripped and stumbled, but laughed with glee,  
                For every fall was wild and free.  
                At last, he reached his comfy bed,  
                And dreamed of more adventures ahead.
