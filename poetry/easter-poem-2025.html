				<pre>
The stone was rolled, the tomb was bare,
Yet love remained, still shining there.
Through darkest night, the light broke through,
A gift of life, both pure and true.

The lilies bloom with soft perfume,
As hope returns to break the gloom.
What once was lost is found once more,
An open heart, an unlocked door.

Forgiveness flows like morning rain,
It washes clean the deepest pain.
The past is gone, the soul made new,
Each step now bathed in brighter hue.

A humble cross, a rising sun,
Reminds us all of battles won.
That from the grave new life can start,
With love that mends the hardest heart.

No chains remain, no fear holds tight,
The dawn has come to end the night.
With every breath, we rise again,
Transformed by grace we can't contain.

So lift your eyes, embrace the day,
Let doubt and sorrow fade away.
For Easter lives not just in spring,
But in the joy that hope can bring.
