				<pre>
Our voices will be heard,
Our freedom will prevail,
No king shall speak the word,
For democracy won’t fail.

The crown shall turn to dust,
The people take command,
For in ourselves we trust,
And strength lies in our hand.

No tyrant holds the chain,
No throne decides our fate,
Through struggle, loss, and pain,
Our union shall be great.

Let justice light the flame,
Let every heart be free,
No ruler stake his claim,
On what is meant to be.

Our voices will be heard,
Our freedom will prevail,
The world shall keep its word,
That liberty won’t fail.
