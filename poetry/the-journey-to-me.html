				<pre>
From childhood’s dawn I felt apart,
A secret whisper in my heart.
I knew I wasn’t who they’d see,
A girl inside, just wanting me.

I cried at night for what I knew,
For body, name, and truth so true.
Each wrong pronoun a deeper scar,
A wish to wake as who you are.

At eleven, fear and hope entwined,
I dressed as me to still my mind.
Discovered quick, their shock was loud,
And shame replaced what once was proud.

My parents struggled, lost, unsure,
But time and talk began to cure.
A bridge was built from tears and pain,
And slowly trust would bloom again.

Puberty struck like cruel disguise,
Each change a wound before my eyes.
I prayed my body would align,
To match the soul I knew was mine.

At nineteen, silence ruled my days,
My mom and I had parted ways.
The weight of life pressed hard on me,
I begged for peace, for clarity.

In darkest hours, no food, no light,
I prayed for strength to end the fight.
Then something deep within me stirred—
A voice of hope, at last, was heard.

My faith renewed, I breathed anew,
And faced the world as someone true.
That moment marked my first sunrise,
When fear gave way to open skies.

My mother’s heart reached out once more,
An email mending what tore before.
She took me out, her daughter free,
And saw the woman I could be.

That day I lived, the first of all,
No longer trapped behind the wall.
Her love returned, my wings unfurled,
A girl reborn within the world.

Then August came, two-thousand-fifteen,
The bravest day I’d ever seen.
I claimed my truth, my rightful name,
And vowed to live without the shame.

Each step I took, my courage grew,
The world now saw the real and true.
My voice was clear, my soul was whole,
At last I’d taken back control.

Wisconsin’s law soon changed the tide,
And surgery aligned inside.
June twenty-twenty sealed the start,
Of body meeting waiting heart.

With healing came a brighter view,
Each step I take is something new.
I’m learning, growing, finding drive,
With temps in hand, I’m still alive.

I rode the rides I feared before,
Felt freedom ripple to my core.
The Dells now echoed with my cheer,
No trace of shame, no trace of fear.

Now every year I celebrate,
The life I built, the twist of fate.
For living true is victory’s key,
And that’s the journey—the journey to me.
