Language shapes our inner space,
It sculpts the world, sets every pace.
The way we speak, the terms we choose,
Can build us up or make us lose.

From the day we learn to say our name,
Words are tools we wield in the same.
But language’s weight, it’s vast and wide,
It colors thoughts we keep inside.

Labels placed without deep thought,
Can wound a soul, leave battles fought.
A “he” or “she,” or “they” or “we,”
Define how humans wish to be.

For trans folks, words can bring deep pain,
When used in ignorance, disdain.
Misgendered often, day by day,
The simplest terms can turn them gray.

Yet language grows, it shifts and bends,
And through that change, the hurt it mends.
To speak with care, with love and heart,
Is how we help, how healing starts.

We must move past just what we know,
And let our understanding grow.
To listen more, and learn with grace,
Is how we make the world a place.

A name, a word, means more than sound,
In them, identity is found.
And how we phrase, how we express,
Can free or add to their distress.

In classrooms, homes, in open space,
Words define a person’s place.
The terms we speak can lock the gate,
Or open paths to a better fate.

For words aren’t simply set in stone,
They change with how our love is shown.
Through thoughtful language, we unite,
And end the constant needless fight.

Gender is not a simple thing,
It’s vast, diverse, in endless ring.
To honor pronouns, speak with care,
Means more than fairness, more than fair.

For trans lives aren’t trends or paths to blame,
Their truth is real, their hearts the same.
With words of love and tones that trust,
We help restore the bonds we must.

For language is a gift to share,
To hold another in our care.
To call someone by name that’s right,
Is how respect comes into sight.

So let us speak with open hearts,
And play our thoughtful, healing parts.
With every word we choose today,
We pave the road, we light the way.
