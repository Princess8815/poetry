			<pre>
This journey began with a whisper, so small,
A yearning within, yet unnoticed by all.
The mask I once wore, a face not my own,
Concealed the true self I had never been shown.

Through childhood's confusion, I struggled to find,
A way to make sense of the thoughts in my mind.
Was this who I was, or was something astray?
The answer grew clearer with each passing day.

The world cast its judgments, its words cold and cruel,
Its rules and its norms, an unyielding rule.
But I held my ground, though the climb was so steep,
And carried my truth, though the cost was quite deep.

Hormones became the first step on the path,
To soften the scars of society's wrath.
Each change in my body brought joy to my heart,
A puzzle of self finally coming apart.

The mirror grew kinder, yet still held its sting,
For shadows of old would so often still cling.
But courage has blossomed, and now I can see,
The woman inside who was waiting for me.

And now, with the future so close in my sight,
Facial feminization will set things alight.
A face that aligns with the soul deep within,
A harmony found where discord had been.

The surgeons will sculpt, with precision and care,
A reflection to love, a face I can wear.
No longer will strangers misread who I am,
No more will their words feel as sharp as a slam.

This journey's been long, but the triumph is near,
A life free of shadows, of doubt, and of fear.
The road isn't over, but one thing is true:
I‚Äôm proud of the woman the world will now view.

So here's to the future, the battles I've won,
To living with joy and embracing the sun.
The scars will remind me how far I have come,
A journey of strength, and I‚Äôm far from done.
