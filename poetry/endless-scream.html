			<div class="poem-text">
				<pre>
Beneath the weight of shattered skies
A broken voice began its cries
No death to take, no breath to keep
No dawn to end their endless weep

The nerves ignited, sparked, and screamed
The world distorted, split, and streamed
Each second clawed into the bone
Each moment birthed a darker tone

The clock dissolved, the hours bled
The tortured mind was ripped and shred
A single breath became a year
A single blink was drowned in fear

No stars, no sun, no blessed light
No hope to end the endless night
The senses twisted, writhed, and screamed
In landscapes only pain had dreamed

The hands of time were split apart
And stitched anew with broken heart
No future born, no past remained
Only the pulse of endless pain

The skin decayed, the muscles broke
Each breath a gasp, each word a choke
The voice gave out, yet still they cried
Inside a tomb where hope had died

Their memories ran thin and black
The mind was torn, there was no track
Each phantom scream, each burning flame
Etched deeper into ruined brain

No longer human, flesh or soul
No single thought to patch the hole
A hollow thing of twitch and spasm
Alive within an endless chasm

And yet the body clung to breath
Refusing even kindly death
Trapped in a coil of bloody wire
Where each new throb rebirthed the fire

Each nerve would sing, each vein would roar
Their universe a single sore
A thousand deaths, a thousand screams
Reflected in a shattered dream

At last the self was burned away
The mind forgot the light of day
No voice, no name, no silent prayer
Only the echo of despair

Still breathing, broken, and unseen
The prisoner of the Eternal Scream
No death to grant the final fall
No god to hear their endless call
