				<pre>
If I take my life,
It will not be from strife,
But remember me for who I tried to be,
A girl who only wished to live and see.

If my strength is gone,
It’s been gone for far too long,
Remember the warmth I left behind,
Not just the pain upon my mind.

If I can’t move on,
My hope has been long gone,
Keep my truth within your heart,
And never let my name depart.

If I fade away,
I lived it my own way,
Remember the smile I used to show,
And all the love I tried to grow.

If I take my life,
I’ll still be in the light,
Hold me close in what you do,
And let my soul live on through you.

If I choose to stay,
I’ll find a brighter day,
For every tear that once fell down,
A seed of hope will touch the ground.

If my strength returns,
It’s from the pain that burns,
I’ll use those scars to light my flame,
And rise beyond the hurt and shame.

If I move along,
I’ll sing a truer song,
My voice will echo clear and true,
For every girl still fighting through.

If I see the sun,
My healing has begun,
I’ll take the pain I’ve known before,
And turn it into something more.

If I choose to stay,
I’ll make my own way,
And when the night begins to gray,
I’ll stand in light and find my day.

Whether I choose to live or die,
Promise that you’ll still try,
To love, to stand, to raise your voice,
For every soul denied their choice.
