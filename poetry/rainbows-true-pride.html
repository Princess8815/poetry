				<pre>
Red, the color of courage bold,
In every heart, your story’s told.
For those who fight and stand with pride,
Your strength is something none can hide.
You rise above, you break the mold,
A spirit fierce, a heart of gold.

Orange shines bright like the morning sun,
A new day rising, just begun.
For those who need a gentle glow,
Your hope is something that will grow.
No matter what the world may say,
You light the path and lead the way.

Yellow beams with warmth and light,
A joy that makes the world feel right.
For those who laugh, who spread the cheer,
Your happiness draws others near.
In every smile, in every dance,
You give the world a second chance.

Green, the color of life renewed,
Of growth, of strength, in all you’ve pursued.
For those who change, who find their way,
You bloom with every passing day.
Your journey’s yours, it’s bright, it’s true,
And every step is meant for you.

Blue, a calm in the wildest storm,
A peace that keeps you safe and warm.
For those who seek a moment’s rest,
You are the comfort, you are the best.
Through all the noise, you find the calm,
A steady heart, a healing balm.

Purple shines with mystery deep,
A color of dreams you hold and keep.
For those who chase the stars above,
You’re filled with magic, hope, and love.
Your spirit soars, you know no bounds,
In every heart, your joy resounds.
