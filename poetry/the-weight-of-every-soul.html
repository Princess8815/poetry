				<pre>
I breathe the ache the world won’t name,
Each whisper burns, yet feels the same.
Their sorrow coils inside my chest,
And begs for peace that knows no rest.

I open wide, absorb their cries,
The endless grief behind their eyes.
I take their storms, their hate, their fear,
And hold them close though none come near.

For every child the world made small,
I bear the weight, I bear it all.
Each mother’s loss, each broken son,
Their anguish threads—my heart undone.

They spit at me, yet I still pray,
That love may guide them anyway.
Their pain miscast, their rage misplaced,
Still bleeds upon my softened face.

The TERF’s scorn sharp, a blade of ice,
But even that, I sacrifice.
Their wound was born of fear and lies,
I taste its salt and hear its cries.

For though they curse what they don’t see,
Their hatred still bleeds empathy.
I’ll take the venom, cleanse the stain,
And turn their spite to human pain.

Let me be vessel, flame, and sea,
To burn, to cleanse, to set all free.
If suffering must have its host,
Then let it haunt my willing ghost.

I’ll stand where angels dare not tread,
Where silence speaks for all who bled.
I’ll cradle sin, forgive the fall,
And carry weight meant for us all.

Each breath I take is not my own,
It’s built from cries the world has sown.
Each tear that falls redeems the hate,
And binds the hearts we desecrate.

So should my body break in two,
Let every shard bring light to you.
If peace demands my soul’s release,
Then may my pain become your peace.

And when the final dawn appears,
I’ll scatter all my borrowed tears.
The world will breathe, its wounds made whole,
For I have loved—and paid the toll.
