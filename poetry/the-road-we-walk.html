				<pre>
The world around feels harsh and cold,
A battle fought for truths untold.
From childhood days, we know inside,
A truth we‚Äôre taught to push aside.

At five, we see the girl we are,
But fear the world won‚Äôt see that far.
In clothes too stiff, we wear a mask,
A boy‚Äôs life forced, a painful task.

They call me "he," though she I be,
In mirrors lost, I cannot see.
At home, in school, the names they throw,
Words pierce the heart, their weight we know.

Bathrooms barred, "Which door is right?"
In the mirror‚Äôs gaze, I lose my fight.
Policies built to block my way,
Each step to live, I have to pay.

Doctors hold the keys I need,
But gatekeepers slow my speed.
A list of checks, a pile of proof,
As though my soul could ever spoof.

And when at last, the scripts begin,
A fight for coverage to get within.
Insurance balks at "this expense,"
As though my worth is too immense.

From job boards where I change my name,
I carry hope they‚Äôll treat the same.
But whispers fly, they‚Äôre quick to judge,
"Can she be strong? Can we still trust?"

Housing's cruel, the laws unsure,
They question if my life‚Äôs secure.
"Are you a man?" they boldly ask,
Another wound in this cruel task.

On the street, a constant fear,
Of stares, of threats that come too near.
For some, the street‚Äôs where we must live,
Rejected by those who won't forgive.

In love, a struggle‚Äôs deep inside,
Will they love me? Can I hide?
The dating pool so full of dread,
With every secret softly said.

For every friend that walks away,
The bonds of trust feel thin as clay.
Family too, may turn their back,
Afraid of what their lives now lack.

And for those lucky to find care,
The surgery leads to further stares.
They claim the scars are proof we lie,
When all we sought was wings to fly.

Laws and rights, a constant war,
A system fighting to ignore,
Our right to marry, or to lead,
As though our lives were filled with greed.

And mental health, a stormy sea,
Of trauma, stress, and endless plea.
For suicide, the stats so stark,
For many trans girls, life grows dark.

Yet through this pain, we rise, we shine,
Our spirits fierce, our hearts divine.
We build our chosen family tight,
With those who see our truest light.

In every tear, in every scar,
We show the world just who we are.
The road is long, the path unclear,
But in each step, we conquer fear.

So stand with us, embrace our fight,
For trans women, our truth, our right.
Our lives are more than struggles told,
We seek to live, to love, be bold.
