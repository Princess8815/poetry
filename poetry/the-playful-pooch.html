				<pre>
There once was a pooch with a nose for surprise,
A wag in his tail and a glint in his eyes.
He barked at the mailman, he chewed up my shoe,
He stole half a pizza (and maybe some too).

He dug up the garden to search for a bone,
Then tracked muddy footprints all over the home.
He chased all the squirrels, he barked at the bees,
He knocked down Aunt Martha and ran off with cheese.

He rolled in the flowerbed, splattered in mud,
He jumped in the bathtub and started a flood.
He leapt on the table, devoured the roast,
He howled at the vacuum like it was a ghost.

He shredded the couch in a flurry of fuzz,
Then blamed it on "gravity" — (as puppies does).
He unrolled the toilet paper straight down the hall,
And proudly proclaimed, "I'm redecorating, y'all!"

He wrestled my socks till they both disappeared,
He popped out of closets and barked till I feared.
He ate half my homework, he peed on my hat,
He wrestled the neighbor's unfortunate cat.

But when he curls up at the end of the day,
And sighs in my lap in his mischievous way,
I scratch his soft ears and I just have to grin—
For life’s much more fun with a rascal like him.
