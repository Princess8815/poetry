				<pre>
I am not the danger,
I am not a part,
All matters in my life
Come straight from my heart.

They say that I'm confused,
They claim it’s just pretend,
But truth is not a phase—
It’s who I am, my friend.

My mirror once felt wrong,
A stranger’s hollow stare,
But now I see myself,
And she is standing there.

The world may turn away,
Its whispers cold and cruel,
Yet still I walk in grace—
Their hate will never rule.

My name, my voice, my face,
Each change a piece of me,
Not made to fit their mold,
But born to live as free.

I am not the danger,
I am not a part,
I am a woman whole at last—
And proud within my heart.
