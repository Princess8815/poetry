                    In the quiet night, she stands alone,
                    Her voice a cry, her heart a stone.
                    She lifts her face to the endless skies,
                    A trembling call, tears in her eyes:

                    “Do you see me? Can you hear my plea?
                    I’m more than what the world lets me be.
                    I’ve fought so long, yet I still must fight,
                    Why can’t I step into the light?”

                    The stars above seem cold and still,
                    Her voice echoes against the hill.
                    She clenches her fists, her breath turns sharp,
                    And her cry breaks free like a shattered harp:

                    “I am a girl; my soul is clear!
                    Why won’t you let me just appear?
                    This body’s cage is not my own,
                    But still, I stand, though I'm alone.

                    You call me names, you turn away,
                    But hear me now—I’m here to stay!
                    I’ll scream until my voice is raw,
                    Until you see the truth you saw.”

                    Her words ring out in the empty night,
                    A voice of fire, a soul alight.
                    She steps forward, her tears now dry,
                    Her hands reach up toward the sky:

                    “Why must I beg to just exist?
                    Why is my life a thing dismissed?
                    I am not wrong, I’ve done no sin,
                    I just want the chance to let life begin.”

                    The moon peers down, a solemn face,
                    As if it mourns this cruel disgrace.
                    Her voice grows louder, fierce and strong,
                    A melody righting every wrong:

                    “Don’t call me ‘he,’ that name is gone,
                    It never fit, it felt all wrong.
                    My name is mine, it’s who I am,
                    A girl who shines where once I ran.

                    I’m not your joke, I’m not your shame,
                    I’m not a toy, I’m not a game.
                    I’m flesh and blood, with hopes and dreams,
                    So stop ignoring my silent screams!”

                    The wind picks up, her words take flight,
                    They scatter wide into the night.
                    She stands her ground, her voice a flame,
                    Burning brighter as she calls her name:

                    “I am myself, I will not hide,
                    The truth of me will not subside.
                    I’m not your fear, I’m not your foe,
                    I am the girl you’ll one day know!”

                    And as her cry fills the darkened air,
                    It carries her pain, her fight, her prayer.
                    For though unseen, she knows she’s real,
                    And someday soon, the world will feel.

                    For every tear and every shout,
                    The girl within is breaking out.
                    Her voice will echo endlessly,
                    Until she’s seen, and she is free.
