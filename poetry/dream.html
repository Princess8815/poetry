			<pre>
A love so pure, it sets me free,  
Unfolding dreams for all to see.  
The rush of life, a thrilling call,  
With open hearts, we break the wall.  

Oh, what a joy this love can bring,  
A boundless hope in everything.  
Each moment shines, a gift to share,  
A gentle breeze fills up the air.  

Your voice, a song, it stirs my soul,  
It lifts me up and makes me whole.  
No bounds exist, no chains to bind,  
With you, I leave my fears behind.  

Each step we take, the world unfolds,  
Its secrets shared, its stories told.  
The light of dreams within our eyes,  
A flame that burns, a fire that flies.  

The winds of change may come and go,  
But through it all, our love will grow.  
In endless skies, our hearts will soar,  
Forever seeking, wanting more.  

Together bound, yet free as streams,  
We chase the sun, we weave our dreams.  
For love and life, a truth so rare,  
In every breath, you're always there.
