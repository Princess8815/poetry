			<pre>
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
When morning breaks, but I‚Äôm not dawn?
Will echoes whisper through the air,
Of memories we used to share?

Will you miss me when I'm gone?
When laughter fades, its warmth withdrawn?
Will empty spaces call my name,
Or will the world go on the same?

Will you miss me when I'm gone?
When time moves fast, yet feels so wrong?
Will shadows stretch where I once stood,
Or vanish, lost in faded wood?

Will you miss me when I'm gone?
When songs we loved still play at dawn?
Will melodies still spark a tear,
Or will they drift and disappear?

Will you miss me when I'm gone?
When seasons change and years move on?
Will autumn leaves still feel the same,
Or burn to ash without a flame?

Will you miss me when I'm gone?
When night returns but I am none?
Will stardust paint my love for you,
Or will you chase the morning dew?
