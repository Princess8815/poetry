She sat them down, her heart a drum,
Her voice unsteady, her fingers numb.
“Mom, Dad, I’ve something I need to say,
It’s been hidden inside, but not one more day.”

Her father frowned, his brow pulled tight,
“What’s this about? It doesn’t feel right.
You’ve been distant, quiet—what’s going on?
Just tell us, we’re here; we’ll help you along.”

“No trouble,” she said, her voice like a sigh,
“But I’ve lived for years trapped in a lie.
I’m not your son; I never was.
I’m your daughter, and I am because
This is who I’ve always been,
A truth I’ve buried deep within.”

Her mother gasped, her hands to her face,
“This doesn’t make sense! It feels out of place.
You’re our boy, our shining star,
Not… this—how did it go this far?”

“I’ve tried to be what you wanted to see,
But that person you love—it isn’t me.
I need to be true, to live as I am,
Not trapped in a life that’s all a sham.”

Her father stood, his chair scraped loud,
His voice came harsh, his anger proud.
“You’re confused—it’s a passing whim!
How could you expect us to live with this sin?
You’re our son; that’s who you’ll stay,
You can’t just rewrite your life this way!”

She stayed her ground, though her tears brimmed bright,
“Dad, I’ve fought this with all my might.
I’ve hidden in shame; I’ve tried to pretend,
But the pain won’t stop—it never ends.
I’m not confused, I know who I am,
Your daughter who’s done hiding from the sham.”

Her mother’s tears began to fall,
“This feels like losing you—like losing it all.
How can we bear it? What will they say?
The world will judge us every day.”

“Mom,” she pleaded, her voice a cry,
“I’ve faced the world; I’ve lived the lie.
But your love is the only thing I need,
To let my heart finally be freed.
The world is cruel, but you’re my home,
Without your support, I’ll face it alone.”

Her father’s hands clenched; his jaw grew tight,
“This isn’t easy—it doesn’t feel right.
You were born a boy; that’s what’s true,
How can we just undo what we knew?”

“You don’t lose me,” she said, her tone now strong,
“You gain who I’ve been all along.
I’m still your child, your blood, your kin,
Just no longer hiding beneath my skin.”

A silence fell, heavy and long,
The room was still; the air felt wrong.
Her mother spoke first, her voice unsure,
“Give us time—we’ll try to endure.
This is so new, so hard to see,
But you’re still our child, and always will be.”

Her father sighed, his face unread,
His voice low and soft as he finally said,
“If this is your truth, we’ll try to believe,
Though it’s a world we’ve yet to perceive.
You’re still our child, we love you so,
And we’ll do our best as we learn and grow.”

Tears spilled freely; she hugged them tight,
Their love surrounding her in the night.
“Thank you,” she whispered, her heart alive,
“With you by my side, I know I’ll survive.
This journey is hard, but I’m not alone,
With parents like you, I’ve found my home.”
