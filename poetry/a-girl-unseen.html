				<pre>
The sky was wide, the grass was green,
They played with shadows, danced unseen.
No name, no role, just breath and skin—
The world felt whole when it let them in.

But mirrors told a colder tale,
A shape that always felt too pale.
Their face, a mask they couldn't wear,
A silent scream behind a stare.

They traced their skin like foreign land,
A body built by no command.
Each curve, each edge, not truly theirs—
A costume stitched from others' stares.

So they became a crafted shell,
Learned how to pass, and pass too well.
A voice rehearsed, a laugh on cue—
A perfect lie the world called "true."

The days grew long with weight unseen,
A war inside where none had been.
They smiled through pain, and spoke with grace,
While grief kept blooming in its place.

They dyed their hair, they changed their name,
Each little step a quiet flame.
A spark against the dark they'd known—
A way to claim a self alone.

One day they spoke, their voice unsure,
To someone they had hoped was pure.
But kindness cracked and turned to stone—
They learned again: this fight’s alone.

The silence came like falling snow,
And wrapped around the hurt they’d show.
No one asked what hid beneath,
They only praised the air they breathed.

The breaking came without a sound,
A soft collapse beneath the ground.
Not sudden, not a bolt or cry—
Just one last breath they let slip by.

It wasn’t rage, it wasn’t fear,
It was the weight of every year.
Of being seen, yet never known,
Of calling out, and being alone.

Some lit a flame, some looked away,
Some cried, while others had nothing to say.
Their name was said, but not quite right—
Another ghost too tired to fight.

And still, in rooms they used to pace,
The air feels hollow, holds their trace.
In every glance that looks too long,
A whisper sings where they belong.

The note they left was soft and clear,
A voice for those who could not hear.
Not begging sorrow, shame, or plea—
But simply: “Please remember me.”

Remember those who walk unheard,
Who live their truth in fractured words.
Don't wait to see what they became—
Reach now. And love them, all the same.
