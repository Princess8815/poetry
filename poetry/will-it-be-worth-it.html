				<pre>
Will it be worth it when trans folks can’t live,
Stripped of their rights with no hope to give?
A dozen eggs dropped fifty cents—
While freedom cracks at our expense.

Will it be worth it when books are banned,
Truth erased by a trembling hand?
You saved five bucks at the grocery store—
But justice dies behind the door.

Will it be worth it when climate burns,
And every breath leaves aching lungs in turns?
Sure, gas got cheap for half a week—
But glaciers weep and oceans speak.

Will it be worth it when women lose say,
In courts where old men take rights away?
He promised jobs that never came—
But left our daughters bound in shame.

Will it be worth it when lies grow bold,
And hate's paraded, bought, and sold?
He gave you truth in a red ballcap—
But traded your soul for a fascist trap.

Will it be worth it—when history writes
That silence bowed to profit’s heights?
The cost was hope, the price was trust—
And all you gained... will rot to dust.
