She stared at the mirror, unsure of her face,
A reflection of someone who felt out of place.
The world saw a boy, but deep down she knew,
There was a girl inside, waiting to break through.

From the start, she carried the weight,
Of society’s norms and the world’s cruel fate.
“Act like a boy, be tough and tall,”
But deep in her heart, it didn’t feel right at all.

Dresses in secret, makeup in the night,
Moments alone when everything felt right.
But in the daylight, she had to pretend,
Wishing for strength to finally transcend.

At school, the whispers followed her near,
“Why is he different? Is he really sincere?”
She held her head down, hiding her shame,
Dreaming of freedom and shedding her name.

Home was no refuge, only more strife,
Her parents refused to see her true life.
“You’re just confused,” they’d say with a glare,
“You’ll come around; it’s just not your affair.”

At night, she’d lie under the stars,
Wishing to escape to a place without scars.
A world where her heart and her body align,
Where she could break free and truly shine.

One day, she decided no longer to hide,
The truth in her heart she could not abide.
“I am your daughter; I’m not who you see,
This is the real me, and I need to be free.”

Her parents were shaken; their shock ran deep,
But this was a promise she vowed to keep.
“I know it’s hard, and you don’t understand,
But I can’t keep living under your command.”

The road ahead was steep and long,
But for the first time, she felt strong.
Doctors and papers, steps to embrace,
Each one a part of her journey to grace.

Hormones brought change, slow but true,
Her body began to reflect what she knew.
Her voice, her face, her very core,
Started to show the girl she’d longed for.

She faced the world with courage anew,
No more pretending; she lived what was true.
Though whispers and stares still followed behind,
She stood tall and proud, with peace in her mind.

Some friends were lost, but some stayed near,
And those who loved her made her feel clear.
The road wasn’t easy, but she wouldn’t fall,
For now, she knew herself through it all.

In time, her family began to see,
That their daughter was who she was meant to be.
It wasn’t quick; it wasn’t free of tears,
But their love grew stronger through all of the years.

Now she stands in the light of day,
A trans girl who finally found her way.
No longer hiding, no longer afraid,
She’s the woman she was always made.

The battles aren’t over, the journey’s not done,
But she walks with pride, embracing the sun.
For she knows her truth, and she’s here to say,
“I’m a girl, and I’m here to stay.”
