				<pre>
Can you hear me calling through the noise?
Can you feel the ache behind my voice?
Each word I speak is laced with flame,
A quiet cry that dares to name.

Look into my eyes and you will see,
No matter the world, we can still be free.
Though shadows crawl and silence grows,
A spark within still softly glows.

No matter the life or the pain we've known,
We don't have to walk this path alone.
Through broken dreams and midnight fears,
We'll stitch the cracks with all our tears.

Even if the road is long and gray,
We'll find our strength and light the way.
With every step, a truth we find:
We're not defined by what’s behind.

No matter how far we choose to roam,
Together we'll learn what it means to be home.
A place not built with stone or steel,
But hearts that dare at last to feel.

Can you see my face through all this rain?
Can you feel my hope beneath the pain?
Though time may try to wear me down,
I will not break—I will not drown.

I'm falling fast—please help me stand,
But I believe we'll find dry land.
If you reach back when I reach out,
We'll rise again, despite the doubt.

So take my hand, don't look away—
We'll find a way... we'll be okay.
The night may howl, the wind may bite,
But still we'll step into the light.
