				<pre>
Beneath the weight of endless pain,
She stood alone, in fear and shame.
A razor's edge, a silent cry,
A question whispered: “Why not die?”

Her room was dark, her heart was cold,
The world outside seemed harsh and old.
She’d borne the scorn of cruel disdain,
Each word a mark, a lasting stain.

The mirror showed a stranger’s face,
A cruel reminder, a bitter space.
“They’ll never see the girl I am,
I’m just a fraud, a broken sham.”

With shaking hands, she wrote a note,
The pain of years in every quote.
“No one will miss me when I’m gone,
I’ve lived this lie for far too long.”

But just as tears began to flow,
Her phone lit up with a subtle glow.
A message sent, a simple line,
“Are you okay? You’ve been on my mind.”

She stared a moment, hands unsure,
Could this be real, a lifeline pure?
Her trembling fingers typed with care,
“I’m fine, don’t worry, I’m just… there.”

The friend replied, “Don’t lie to me,
I know you’re struggling, let me see.
Whatever’s wrong, I’ll help you through,
I’m here for you, I promise you.”

The words struck deep, they made her pause,
This friend had seen beyond her flaws.
“Do you mean it? If I told you,
Would you stay, or would you go too?”

“I’d never leave,” the friend replied,
“My heart would break if you just died.
You’re not alone, you’re not a sin,
The world’s the one that’s broken, not you within.”

With trembling breath, the truth poured out,
The pain, the fear, the constant doubt.
“I’m not the person they think they see,
I’m her inside, but I can’t be free.”

The friend replied with words so kind,
“You are enough, don’t hide your mind.
The girl you are deserves the light,
Not hidden away, but shining bright.”

Tears fell fast, a dam was burst,
Years of anguish, their very worst.
Yet through the pain, a spark began,
A tiny flame, a healing plan.

The friend came over, held her tight,
And stayed with her all through the night.
“You’re not alone, I’ll stand by you,
No matter what the world might do.”

The days went on, and slowly she healed,
The pain still there, but wounds revealed.
With every step, her friend would cheer,
Dispelling darkness, quelling fear.

The note was gone, the blade put away,
She saw the dawn of a brighter day.
Though battles loomed and scars would stay,
She found her strength in love that way.

The friend who stayed had saved her life,
Cut through the pain, the endless strife.
In their embrace, she found her place,
A future built on hope and grace.

Now as she stands, her heart is whole,
Her name her own, her chosen role.
And by her side, her friend remains,
The one who saved her from the pain.
