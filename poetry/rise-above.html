				<pre>
					In a world that doesn’t always see,
					The strength that lies within, let it be.
					Your truth is valid, your heart is strong,
					In this fight for love, you belong.

					Each dawn you rise, a warrior bold,
					Your story’s worth is pure gold.
					Through every trial, every tear,
					You stand tall, face your fear.

					They may not know the road you tread,
					The battles fought, the words unsaid.
					But your spirit shines, a guiding light,
					In the darkest hour, hold on tight.

					For you are more than what they see,
					A soul that’s wild, fierce, and free.
					No chains can bind, no hate can break,
					The love you give, the dreams you make.

					So keep on fighting, keep the flame,
					In your heart, no place for shame.
					This world is yours, and so much more,
					You’re writing history’s every score.

					Never give up, for hope’s alive,
					In every breath, you will survive.
					You’re not alone, you’re never weak,
					Your voice is strong, let it speak.

					Rise above, and claim your place,
					In this world, there’s endless space.
					For every soul, for every dream,
					For you, my love, the future gleams.
