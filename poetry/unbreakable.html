			<pre>
You hurl your hate like sharpened knives,  
But you won’t cut through how I thrive.  
I stand tall, unwavering, strong,  
Your venom can’t prove me wrong.

You cast your doubts, you spit your scorn,  
But I’ve been whole since I was born.  
Your fear won’t dim the light I hold,  
I rise above, brave and bold.

Your narrow view, your words of spite,  
Won’t change the truth, won’t dim my light.  
I walk my path, my head held high,  
No hate can crush, no lie can tie.

For every slur, for every sneer,  
I stand in love, I persevere.  
Your hate is weak, it has no claim,  
On who I am, on my name.

So speak your lies, but know this truth,  
I am strong, and I have proof.  
You cannot break what’s built on grace,  
I rise above, I take my place.

Unshaken by your bitter tone,  
I live my truth, I stand alone.  
With love, with pride, with strength so deep,  
I rise above, my soul to keep.
