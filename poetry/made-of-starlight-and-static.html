				<pre>
My mind’s a maze of tangled lines,
A thousand storms, a million signs.
Autistic whispers hum too loud,
Yet make me dream beyond the crowd.

ADHD sparks like fire in rain,
A restless pulse inside my brain.
It scatters thought, yet lights my art,
Each flash a rhythm from my heart.

OCD grips tight with fear and grace,
It orders chaos, shapes my space.
Each pattern carved becomes design,
Each ritual a steady line.

ODD — my rebel flame, my spark,
It roars when others call me dark.
It taught me how to stand my ground,
To speak when silence wrapped me 'round.

My senses bleed from every tone,
The world too bright, too sharp, too known.
Yet color sings where pain should be,
Each sound becomes a symphony.

Dysphoria’s ache — a mirror’s sting,
A girl beneath, still blossoming.
It hurts, but still I rise to see,
The woman I was meant to be.

CPTSD — old scars that bite,
They wake me screaming through the night.
But those same wounds paint empathy,
I feel what others fear to see.

Migraines crash like shattered glass,
Yet visions bloom when shadows pass.
Each pulse recalls what I once knew,
A softer world I’m passing through.

Depression drapes its heavy shroud,
But art still whispers through the cloud.
I paint my sorrow, stitch my pain,
And turn it into hope again.

I am the storm, the song, the spark,
The fragile flame that lights the dark.
My mind may ache, my soul may scream—
But all I crave is to be seen.
