				<pre>
In shadows deep where secrets lie,
She whispered dreams into the sky.
A child with hopes both fierce and sweet,
Who longed for wings upon her feet.

Yet burdened by a world unkind,
Her heart a storm, her spirit blind.
They called her names, dismissed her cries,
But flames of truth still burned her eyes.

A heart of steel wrapped soft in lace,
She dared to find her hidden place.
Each mirror lied, each glance would sting,
Yet still she longed for what life brings.

The nights grew long, the journey cold,
As years passed by, she grew more bold.
She carved her path through tangled fear,
With every tear a truth made clear.

The world, a cage of hardened steel,
Yet in her soul, she learned to feel.
Through winding paths of doubt and shame,
She found the power in her name.

Her friends, her foes—each one a test,
She learned to trust her heart's unrest.
For battles fought alone at night,
Had shaped her strength, her will to fight.

The sky, once dim, began to glow,
As courage taught her how to grow.
No chains could bind her spirit’s light,
She rose, a beacon in the night.

Each scar, a badge, a story told,
Of hidden strength and dreams so bold.
With every wound and bruise she wore,
She stood more tall, her spirit soared.

A stranger once within her skin,
She fought, she bled, to find within
The voice she knew, the self denied,
And left the lies she’d lived behind.

They spoke of rules, they spoke of shame,
Yet love and truth ignited flame.
No longer trapped in webs they’d spun,
She met her truth, her war was won.

With gentle hands, she healed each scar,
And let her heart become a star.
For she had weathered storms of pain,
And danced beneath the darkened rain.

And now, she stands, both proud and whole,
A phoenix risen from the coal.
Her journey, fierce and deeply true,
A testament to what she knew.

For every tear, a river flows,
For every loss, a beauty grows.
In the mirror, she sees her face,
A life reclaimed, a world embraced.

No longer bound by others' fears,
She moves beyond her haunted years.
For she’s a girl of radiant fire,
And lives to lift her dreams up higher.

Through winding paths and shadows cast,
She forged her way, she’s free at last.
With open arms and endless grace,
She leaves her mark on time and space.

Her journey’s end? No, just begun,
She moves toward light, a rising sun.
For every girl who’s yet to be,
She shines a light that all may see.
