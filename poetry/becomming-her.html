			<div class="poem-text">
				<pre>
She lived beneath a painted sky,
A girl who learned to laugh and lie.
Her mirror whispered, soft but cold,
“You’re not the one you wish to hold.”

She wore the name they gave with pride,
But deep within, a part had died.
Each smile she made, each breath she woke,
Felt fragile—like a dream that broke.

She prayed at night to feel the same,
To fit her skin, to hide her shame.
But every prayer returned in flame,
Each echo calling out her name.

She screamed inside, “This isn’t me!”
Her heart begged loud, “I need to be!”
The walls replied with silence bare,
Her pain hung heavy in the air.

The world grew sharp, the voices cruel,
Her tears became her quiet fuel.
She bit her tongue, she held her breath,
And courted peace in thoughts of death.

But even there, a spark remained,
A voice within that still proclaimed:
“I am the girl you cannot kill,
I breathe, I burn, I always will.”

She rose from scars the world had drawn,
A phoenix dressed in blood and dawn.
Her heart still cracked, her voice still raw,
But she became her truest law.

She faced the mirror, eyes alight,
And whispered, “You don’t own my fight.”
Then tore away the lies she’d worn,
And from her pain, a girl was born.

She learned that strength was made from tears,
That love can grow from shattered years.
Her war was long, her wounds ran deep,
But she became the vow she’d keep.

Now calm returns, but not the same,
The storm inside no longer flame.
She stands where once her silence bled—
Alive, reborn, no longer dead.
