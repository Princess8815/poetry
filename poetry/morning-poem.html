			<pre>
Good morning, dear, a brand new day is here,  
A time to rise, to banish doubt and fear.  

The sun ascends, its rays so warm and bright,  
A golden promise in the morning light.  

Today’s a canvas, fresh and pure as snow,  
With every step, your masterpiece will grow.  

Let courage guide you, let your heart be bold,  
For dreams await, more precious than pure gold.  

Each bird that sings, each leaf that softly sways,  
Reminds us life unfolds in wondrous ways.  

No mountain’s high, no valley far too deep,  
The stars are yours, if faith in self you keep.  

So chase the dawn, and let your spirit soar,  
Discover paths you’ve never walked before.  

Though shadows linger, they shall never stay,  
For hope will always light your darkest day.  

Embrace the breeze, let laughter fill the air,  
Find beauty hidden in the world out there.  

Each moment’s fleeting, like the morning dew,  
So treasure every one that’s gifted you.  

You are a beacon, shining bright and clear,  
A force of love to all who hold you near.  

So take this day, with all its ups and downs,  
And wear it proudly, like a victor’s crown.  

For every sunrise whispers, “You are strong,”  
And fills your heart with purpose all day long.  

Good morning, dear, the world awaits your stride,  
With every step, let love and joy collide.
