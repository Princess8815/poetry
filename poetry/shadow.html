                Beneath the sun, it stretched and grew,  
                A creeping form with shapes askew.  
                No friend was it, no source of light,  
                Its presence bound her heart with fright.  

                Its steps would follow close behind,  
                A constant weight upon her mind.  
                No matter where she chose to stray,  
                The shadow loomed and blocked her way.  

                At dusk, it whispered from the dark,  
                Its voice a chilling, jagged spark.  
                “You cannot run, you cannot hide,  
                I am the truth you keep inside.”  

                She gasped and turned, her footsteps quick,  
                Her fear grew heavy, her pulse grew thick.  
                Through tangled woods, she fled in vain,  
                The shadow surged through field and plain.  

                Its laughter echoed sharp and clear,  
                Each word a dagger to her ear.  
                “You fear me now, but don't you see?  
                I am the you you’ll never free.”  

                She stumbled, fell, and scraped her knee,  
                Her cries drowned out by its decree.  
                “Why must you haunt me? Leave me be!”  
                The shadow hissed, “You’ll answer me.”  

                It grew immense, consumed the ground,  
                Its edges vast, it wrapped around.  
                “You cast me out, you closed the door,  
                But I’m the part you can’t ignore.”  

                Through tears, she screamed, “I will not yield!  
                I’ll fight you here, on any field!”  
                The shadow laughed, its tone grew cold,  
                “You’ve fought in vain; the truth’s been told.”  

                She lunged ahead, her fists in rage,  
                Her shadow met her on the stage.  
                Its force was strong, its will was vast,  
                But she refused to let it last.  

                Through every strike, it stood unmoved,  
                Its voice unwavering, unimproved.  
                “You cannot win, for I’m your kin,  
                Your pain, your doubt, the dark within.”  

                At last, exhausted, she stood still,  
                Her strength betrayed by iron will.  
                Her breath was shallow, tears ran free,  
                And yet the shadow didn’t flee.  

                “You fear me now, but don’t you know?  
                Without my shade, you’d never grow.  
                I’ve shaped your path, I’ve walked your side,  
                I am the truth you cannot hide.”  

                She took a step, her fear subsiding,  
                Her heart once torn, now reconciling.  
                “I’ve run so long, but now I see,  
                The shadow’s not my enemy.”  

                With trembling hands, she faced its form,  
                Her heart a fire, her spirit warm.  
                “You are my strength, my truth, my guide,  
                The part of me I’ve kept inside.”  

                The shadow softened, bent to meet,  
                Its edges blurred, no longer fleet.  
                Their forms entwined, their souls as one,  
                No longer split by light or sun.  

                Through golden fields, she walked anew,  
                A blazing fire, a deeper hue.  
                No longer bound by fear or strife,  
                She’d claimed her shadow and her life.
