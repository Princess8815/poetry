				<pre>
I was born with a whisper, a name in the breeze,
A soul full of colors no one else sees.
But voices around me, they hardened like stone,
Demanded my story be written in bone.

They said, "You are this," and they pointed and named,
They carved out a label, they boxed and they shamed.
But how can a meadow be trapped in one seed?
How can a river be caged in its need?

I wore their assumptions like chains on my skin,
Pretending, contorting, holding it in.
But silent pretending is silence that bleeds,
And hearts that are shackled can never be freed.

One day I shattered, my soul spilling bright,
A thousand new colors exploded in light.
My voice found its courage, my heart found its flame,
I lifted my head and I spoke out my name.

I am not your blueprint, I am not your chart,
I am a whole river, not broken apart.
A whisper, a roar, a beginning, a flight,
A child of the sunset, a seeker of light.

My pronouns are sacred — they mirror my song,
Each syllable righting the places gone wrong.
When you see me, see all, not a guess or a claim,
See the heart, see the fire, see the truth in my name.

It costs you so little, it gives me the sky,
It tells me I matter, it tells me I'm I.
A simple small kindness that burns like a star,
Reminding the lost they are loved as they are.

So pause when you meet me, breathe deep, and begin,
To honor the stories that live in my skin.
Your kindness, your listening, your love sets me free—
A mirror of hope where I’m finally me.
