				<pre>
Even the strongest may fall and the happiest may cry,
A laugh may be cover for wanting to die.
We look at their smiles, assume they’re okay—
Never once hearing the words they don't say.

Perception is power; a glance can be fate,
A whisper misheard may arrive too late.
We see what we want and ignore the rest,
But the truth is, the hurting wear masks with the best.

You see them in daylight, alive in the crowd,
But never hear silence scream louder than loud.
A person can vanish before your own eyes,
Not into darkness—but into goodbyes.

Some people keep living by force of a thread,
While begging for peace to replace what they dread.
They don't need saving, they just need a hand,
Someone to sit with them, just to withstand.

To love is not always to keep them alive,
But walking beside them so long as they strive.
Even if walking means one final mile,
Even if holding means letting them smile.

Death isn't failure—it’s not giving in,
It's sometimes the ending where rest can begin.
For some, there's no healing that this world can bring,
So we stay, and we love, and we soften the sting.

So open your vision and soften your gaze,
Let empathy burn through society’s haze.
Not every pain lives on the skin or in scars—
Some only show when you’re counting the stars.

And if someone fades, don't let shame remain,
Say they were seen in their deepest of pain.
That they were not hidden, not hushed or denied,
But known, and still loved, as they laid down and died.
