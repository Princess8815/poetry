				<pre>
Let us laugh beneath the open sky,
Where worries shrink and spirits fly.
In every joke, a spark of light,
To guide us through the darkest night.

Let us play like children do,
In fields of green and skies of blue.
No scoreboard needed, just delight,
In games that stretch from noon to night.

Let us learn with open hearts,
From books and life and nature’s arts.
For wisdom blooms in questions deep,
And knowledge wakes where silence sleeps.

Let us create from thought and dream,
A world reborn in paint and scheme.
From clay and code, from voice and pen,
We’ll make what never was till then.

Let us enjoy the little things,
The flutter hush of humming wings.
A warm sunbeam, a shared dessert,
A moment’s peace when none are hurt.

Let us love without a cage,
Beyond all borders, creed, or age.
No need to ask, no need to prove—
Just hands held tight in honest truth.

Let us feel without regret,
The joy, the pain we won’t forget.
Each tear and smile, a truth we bear,
Alive because we truly care.

Let us leave no heart behind,
No soul unheard, no voice maligned.
When paths diverge, let kindness stay—
A light to guide the ones who stray.

Let us live with purpose bold,
With stories shared and futures told.
In every breath, a chance to be—
A soul unchained, completely free.
