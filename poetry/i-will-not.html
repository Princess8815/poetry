			<pre>
I will not erase the name you bear,
Though you strip mine with a hateful stare.
Your name holds weight, your name is you,
I’ll never deny it, though you deny mine too.

I will not define who you must love,
Though you claim my bond is not from above.
Your heart is yours, your passion pure,
I’ll never question what makes you sure.

I will not decide what makes you whole,
Though you try to break my very soul.
Your truth is yours, your life your own,
I’ll not destroy what you’ve bravely grown.

I will not block your path to heal,
Though you’d see mine crushed beneath your heel.
May you find peace, may your wounds mend,
Though you’d deny me that same end.

I will not strip away your rights,
Though you attack mine with all your might.
Your freedom matters, your will is yours,
I won’t close your windows or lock your doors.

I will not steal the life you treasure,
Though you treat my joy as worthless pleasure.
Your worth is infinite, no matter your hue,
I won’t take it from you, though you take mine too.

Even though you will do that to me,
Erase my truth and refuse to see,
I’ll rise above, with my heart still true,
Because, quite simply, I’m better than you.
