				<pre>
he pain of others finds my skin,
It crawls beneath, it seeps within.
Each broken voice, each silent cry,
Becomes my own—I can’t deny.

The air grows thick with others’ grief,
Yet I can’t turn, nor find relief.
I feel their hurt, their guilt, their flame,
And somehow still, I bear their shame.

I sense the tears that never fall,
The quiet prayers that reach no wall.
Each whispered “help” from far away,
Still echoes deep in my decay.

Their hate, too, burns—I feel its sting,
Even when not meant for my wing.
The slurs that strike at who I am,
Still tremble through this fragile dam.

The TERFs, their pain—misplaced, untrue,
Yet still it cuts, I feel it too.
For pain does not know wrong or right,
It only asks to share the night.

I hold their fury, though it scars,
Their darkness swallowed by my stars.
Not to redeem, nor to erase,
But to remind them: I have space.

If peace required one heart to break,
I’d offer mine for all their sake.
But not because I think I should,
Or dream that I am something good.

No—just because I always feel,
Each wound that time forgot to heal.
I am no god, no saint, no lie—
I’m just an empath passing by.
