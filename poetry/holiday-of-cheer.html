			<pre>
                The holidays are here, a season of cheer,
                A time for all to gather, far and near.
                No matter your faith, your path, or your creed,
                This is the season for kindness and deed.

                Beneath the twinkling lights, our hearts ignite,
                With warmth and joy on a winter's night.
                Each snowflake unique, like the people we see,
                A tapestry woven with diversity.

                For those who light candles in menorahs so bright,
                Or gather for Kwanzaa with joy and delight,
                To those singing hymns 'round a Christmas tree,
                And those who simply seek unity.

                We honor all paths, from every land,
                Bound by love, we extend our hand.
                From deserts to tundras, from mountains to shore,
                This season reminds us: we‚Äôre so much more.

                To the ones who feel lonely, lost, or afraid,
                Let love be the gift that‚Äôs freely displayed.
                A smile, a gesture, a message sincere,
                Can brighten the heart and bring needed cheer.

                For families chosen, for friendships so true,
                For those who are old, and for those who are new,
                Let‚Äôs cherish the moments, both big and small,
                And celebrate humanity, embracing us all.

                For trans folk, for queer folk, for everyone‚Äôs voice,
                For every identity, let‚Äôs all rejoice.
                Our differences shine like stars in the sky,
                Together, we soar, our spirits fly high.

                For children who laugh, for elders who dream,
                For those who envision a world full of gleam,
                Let‚Äôs work hand in hand for a future so bright,
                Guided by hope, and compassion's light.

                So deck every hall and trim every tree,
                Celebrate love in every degree.
                May this season bring peace, like a warm embrace,
                To every heart and every place.

                As the year softly fades and the new one begins,
                Let kindness and courage be where it all spins.
                For the holidays teach us one simple truth:
                The greatest of gifts is love‚Äôs endless youth.
