There’s no way I can explain,
The storm that floods my chest with pain,
It grows much worse when I’m alone,
A silent ache carved into bone.

I whisper words no one can hear,
They fade away, yet still draw near,
Each breath a plea I can’t defend,
I’m begging for this ache to end.

I search for light through endless night,
But shadows choke my fragile sight,
Therapy may try to mend,
Yet peace feels far, around the bend.

I long to leave, to just escape,
To flee the walls that hold my shape,
A home that’s house but not a heart,
A cage that tears my soul apart.

I know they’ll say to kneel and pray,
But I already do each day,
My tears fall down like holy rain,
And still I wake to feel the same.

I’m tired of trying to be heard,
Of fighting life with every word,
Of screaming truth to hearts of stone,
While breaking quietly alone.

The world moves on, I fade from view,
A wound that time will never heal.
They’ll never grasp the weight I bear,
The cost of simply breathing air.

My faith still flickers, weak but real,
A fragile flame I barely feel,
I pray for warmth, a softer tone,
A place to call my very own.

If hope still lives, it hides from me,
A wilted bloom I cannot see,
Yet still I stand through every fall,
And try to rise despite it all.

So if I break, please understand,
I fought as long as I could stand,
I never wished to fade away—
I only longed for peace someday.
