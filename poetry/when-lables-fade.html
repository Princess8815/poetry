				<pre>
There’ll come a day when walls will fall,
And love will rise to welcome all.
The world will see beyond disguise,
And truth will shine through open eyes.

When “he” and “she” no longer bind,
The endless hues of humankind.
No box to check, no cage to stay,
Just souls that dance their own pure way.

The world’s not ready, not today,
But we will guide and light the way.
Through storms of hate, through years of strife,
We’ll carve the path to freer life.

For when that day at last is near,
No shame, no chains, no pain, no fear.
A world reborn in unity’s blend—
Where freedom’s song will never end.

And when that dawn ignites the sky,
The old constraints will fade and die.
For love will rule, and hearts will see—
We were always meant to just be free.
