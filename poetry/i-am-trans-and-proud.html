			<pre>
                I am trans and proud, my voice is clear,  
                To love all people, I hold most dear.  
                No matter your journey, your path, your name,  
                We all share a light, a human flame.

                Love your neighbors, your friends, your foes,  
                For kindness blossoms wherever it grows.  
                Reach for the hearts of those around,  
                In every soul, a treasure is found.

                No wrong way exists to live your truth,  
                Cherish your wisdom, your fire, your youth.  
                From all backgrounds, we rise, we shine,  
                Our stories unique, yet intertwined.

                To my sisters, my brothers, my friends in between,  
                You’re stars in the sky, a radiant scene.  
                No matter your struggle, your climb, your fall,  
                You’re cherished, important, a wonder to all.

                Hate has no place in this world we share,  
                Only love can conquer despair.  
                Hand in hand, let’s build a way,  
                Where all are free to have their say.

                You are valid, you are seen,  
                In every moment, in every dream.  
                No one’s path is better or worse,  
                Each life a poem, each soul a verse.

                Our differences make the world complete,  
                A tapestry woven, intricate, sweet.  
                Embrace yourself, your flaws, your grace,  
                You’re perfect as you, in your rightful place.

                To love is brave, to hate is weak,  
                In love’s embrace, the world we seek.  
                Let us unite, let hearts expand,  
                A brighter future, hand in hand.

                So I say to you, with heart and might,  
                Love yourself and others, ignite the light.  
                We are one, though paths may stray,  
                Together we’ll find a brighter day.

                I am trans and proud, and I proclaim,  
                Our love is boundless, not bound by name.  
                To every human, near and far,  
                You are loved just as you are.
