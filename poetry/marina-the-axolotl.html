			<pre>
Marina the axolotl, lively and spry,
Lived down in the lake where the fish would swim by.
Her pink little gills danced with bubbly delight,
As she darted and dashed through the waters so bright.

One day, a tide swept her far from her reef,
To strange, distant waters beyond all belief.
She wiggled and wriggled, feeling so small,
Far from her cozy, safe, sandy hall.

She set off exploring, no time left to waste,
For Marina had spunk and an adventurous taste.
She wandered past lilies and plants all around,
Wondering how she‚Äôd get back to her ground.

First, she met Storky, a stork with a smirk,
Who eyed her like dinner, with quite the jerk.
"Oh please, Mr. Stork, won't you spare little me?
I promise I'll find you a shrimp or three!"

Storky laughed hard, a laugh like a quake,
And let her go free for the bargain's sake.
Marina sped off with a flick of her tail,
Off on her journey, she could not fail!

Next came a heron, tall and so grand,
With feathers so sleek, like a feathered hand.
"Dear Heron," she pleaded, "I mean you no fight,
Could you help a lost axolotl tonight?"

The heron, quite baffled by her small frame,
Lowered his beak and asked for her name.
"Follow the bubbles," he said with a wink,
"And you‚Äôll find the path much sooner than you think."

Marina swam off with joy in her heart,
Thanking the heron for his helpful part.
But the journey was long, and her legs were so short,
She hoped she‚Äôd find friends for some bubbly support.

Then came a turtle, slow but so sage,
With an ancient shell that had weathered with age.
"Oh Turtle, kind Turtle, may I ride on your shell?
My fins grow so tired, though I‚Äôm doing quite well!".

The turtle agreed, with a nod and a grin,
And Marina climbed on with a splash and a spin.
They journeyed together, through kelp and tall reeds,
The turtle quite slow, but meeting her needs.

They reached a deep cave, so dark and so wide,
Where the fishies would shimmer, then scurry and hide.
In the depths of the cave, glowing mushrooms grew,
Lighting the way in magical blue.

In awe, Marina stared, her eyes open wide,
At the strange, glowing world on the other side.
Just then, from the shadows, two crabs did appear,
Wearing little shell hats and looking quite queer.

"Hello there, Marina!" they sang with delight,
"We‚Äôll dance and we‚Äôll guide you throughout the night!"
The crabs did a jig, a wiggly-wobbly dance,
Inviting Marina to join in their prance.

With a laugh and a twirl, she followed their lead,
Moving her tail with surprising speed.
Through caves and bubbles, and strange coral beds,
The crabs spun in circles and stood on their heads.

The night turned to day, and Marina grew bold,
Her heart full of stories yet to be told.
She thanked her new friends with a wave and a cheer,
Promising to visit again every year.

Back on her own, she found a new track,
Where rainbow fish danced in a magical pack.
They shimmered and sparkled, like diamonds at sea,
And joined Marina in her dance with glee.

Finally, she spotted her reef with a glow,
After her wild, wacky, and wonderful show.
She laughed at her journey, with friends from afar,
Each one unique, like a bright little star.

With a flip of her fins and a splash to the sky,
Marina returned with a wink and a sigh.
And as the lake glowed in the soft setting sun,
Marina knew this was just adventure one.
