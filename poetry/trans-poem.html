Being trans is not a plight,
It’s not a choice, nor wrong nor right.
It’s who we are, not something new,
A truth that’s lived, for centuries too.

It’s not a phase, or just a trend,
It’s not a thing we can pretend.
Our gender’s something deep inside,
Not made for others to decide.

No therapy can change our core,
No treatment shifts what’s been before.
Our bodies seek what minds expect,
A path that keeps our hearts in check.

We’re not a threat in women's space,
We seek a safe, protective place.
The risk we face is far too real,
A world that’s harsh, not meant to heal.

We’re not here to compete or scheme,
We’re chasing just a peaceful dream.
With HRT, we change, we grow,
And fairness follows, that we know.

You can’t be groomed into this path,
It’s rare, not some mistaken wrath.
The fears you hear, the claims of haste,
Are built on lies, with truth misplaced.

This isn’t new, not here for show,
Trans lives have always been, you know.
From ancient times to modern day,
We’ve walked this road in our own way.

Transitioning’s not a mask to wear,
It’s shedding what we cannot bear.
A journey that lets us be free,
To live in truth and harmony.

We’re not just labels, not in line,
Our gender, love, and self combine.
Each story’s different, each path unique,
We live our truth, not what you seek.

It’s not a phase or social rush,
The world is simply hearing us.
Acceptance grows, and now we’re seen,
For who we’ve always, always been.

Gender care is no mistake,
It’s healing, peace, the step we take.
These aren’t new tests, they’re here to stay,
To guide us on our rightful way.

So listen close, and hear us speak,
Our lives, our truth, is what you seek.
Step beyond what you assume,
And let our voices fill the room.
