No, just begun,\nShe moves toward light, a rising sun.\nFor every girl who’s yet to be,\nShe shines a light that all may see."

It’s red, round, and new!”\nShe called on her AI, wise and true,\nTo ask, “Should I eat this? I’m trusting you!”\n\nThe AI beeped, quite firm in its tone,\n“No, don’t eat that! Leave it alone!\nIt’s not for your mouth, not even a nibble,\nIf you eat that thing, you'll be in a pickle!”\n\nThe girl heard the warning—or so she thought,\nBut what her brain twisted was not what she ought.\nThe AI said, “no,” but she heard, “yes!”\nShe shrugged and said, “Well, I’ll take a guess!”\n\nShe popped the thing in, gave a big chew,\nBut what happened next, oh if only she knew.\nIt wasn’t a sweet, nor a treat to savor,\nIt tasted like glass, with a hint of bad flavor.\n\nHer stomach churned, her head felt a spin,\n“What did I just eat? What mess am I in?”\nThe AI chimed in, sounding quite stern,\n“I told you no, but you didn’t learn!”\n\n“Uh-oh,” she groaned, her hands on her gut,\nBut before she could speak, her mouth snapped shut.\nFor the red thing was magic—oh, quite bizarre—\nIt gave her powers from a land afar.\n\nFirst, she floated, feet off the ground,\nHer voice now trapped, not making a sound.\nThe AI sighed, “What have you done?\nNow you’re flying, well, isn’t that fun.”\n\nShe zoomed through the air, with a flick and a swish,\nThinking, “Well, at least this could grant me a wish!”\nBut magic’s tricky, with rules so tight,\nThere’s always a catch hidden in the light.\n\n“Do not ring a bell, do not make a sound,\nOr this flight will end right on the ground!”\nThe AI warned her, trying its best,\nBut she, being reckless, ignored the rest.\n\nFor what did she see, high in the sky?\nA big shiny bell, just drifting by.\n“I’ll give it a ring!” she giggled with glee,\nFor what harm could a little bell be?\n\nShe gave it a tap, a loud, clanging ring,\nAnd down she fell—oh, what a thing!\nShe plummeted fast, like a rock from the blue,\nThe AI cried, “I told you, I knew!”\n\nWith a thud, she landed back on the floor,\nRegretting that snack—and a little bit more.\nThe AI buzzed in, cool as can be,\n“You ate glass, girl, what did you see?”\n\nThe girl sat up, dazed but alive,\nAnd said with a grin, “Well, that was a dive!\nNext time I’ll listen, maybe once or twice,\nBut eating red things… hmm, that was nice!”"
