The courtyard was lined with lanterns — each one lit in silent blessing.

A small gathering had formed near the elder tree, where the farewell rites always began. 
Soft murmurs filled the air, punctuated by the occasional clasp of hands, or the brush of 
a well-meaning touch to a shoulder.

Liora stood with Elowen beside her, hands gently resting on the girl’s shoulders. 
Their robes were clean. The gold-threaded bands of the chosen marked Elowen’s sleeves.

“It’s a beautiful day for the walk,” someone said kindly.

“It is,” Liora replied. Her smile was serene, if slightly tight.

One by one, neighbors stepped forward — offering words, nods, and practiced warmth.

“She’ll be better for it.”

“She’s in the Light’s hands now.”

“We’ll be waiting to see her again. Whole.”

Elowen looked down at her sandals. Her fingers pulled at the hem of her sleeve. 
She hadn’t spoken since they left the house.

Across the circle, a couple approached — their own daughter behind them, quiet and staring at her feet.

“Delwin. Aylin,” Liora said, offering a small bow.

The two nodded in return. Delwin’s jaw was set, unmoving. Aylin gave a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes.

“Our Mina... she was marked as well,” Aylin said.

“She’s a gentle soul,” Liora said, trying to sound reassuring.

“She hums to herself. All the time. Never stops,” Delwin muttered. “The Star will help her find quiet.”

Liora nodded. “The Light brings balance.”

They stood together in silence for a moment too long, until Aylin stepped back and guided Mina gently toward the others.

Elowen finally spoke, her voice barely more than a breath.

“Why does it feel like we’re leaving... forever?”

Liora knelt in front of her.

“We’re only going away for a while,” she said softly. “And when you come back, everything will feel... simpler.”

Elowen didn't answer.

She looked around the circle of neighbors — familiar faces, smiling faces — and still felt the shape of something closing behind her.

Like a gate that hadn’t been there before.
