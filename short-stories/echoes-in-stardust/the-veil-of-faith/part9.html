The house was quiet, save for the soft rustle of fabric and the whispered hum of an old cleansing hymn.

Liora stood at the table, folding Elowen’s ceremonial robe for the third time. It had been pressed that morning, 
but she wanted it perfect — no creases, no loosened threads. The golden embroidery shimmered along the hem like sunlight on water.

Beside the robe, a small wooden token rested on a cloth. Liora had carved it herself — a tiny tree with open branches. 
It symbolized growth, balance, renewal. A gift for the Star. A piece of her daughter, offered in trust.

“Elowen,” she called softly. “Bring your satchel, please.”

Elowen entered quietly. Her fingers fidgeted at her sides. Her satchel was half-zipped and lopsided.

“Come help me wrap the token,” Liora said. “Then we’ll be done.”

Elowen watched as her mother placed the wooden carving into a cloth pouch and tied it shut with a silver ribbon.

“Mama...” she asked, after a long pause, “After the Star... will I still be me?”

Liora didn’t flinch. She kept folding the ribbon, making the bow just right.

“You’ll still be you,” she said gently. “But clearer. Lighter. Like the sun after the fog lifts.”

Elowen tilted her head.

“But what if I like the fog?”

Liora smiled faintly. “That’s just the Curse talking, love. It tries to make the fog feel safe. But it isn’t. 
You’ll understand soon. You’ll feel better.”

Elowen lowered her gaze. “What if I don’t?”

Liora touched her cheek, brushing a bit of charcoal still clinging there from earlier.

“You will,” she said. “The Star doesn’t make mistakes.”

Elowen nodded, but her hands trembled as she pulled the satchel over her shoulder.

The robe was folded. The token was wrapped. Everything was in place.

But something inside her felt less and less like it belonged in the box.
