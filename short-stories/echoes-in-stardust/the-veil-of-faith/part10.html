The path that led out of Auris was lined with smooth white stones, each carved with the 
names of those who had walked it before.

The morning was silent except for the rhythmic sweep of robes against grass and the distant sound 
of ritual hymns echoing from Elder Mariun’s lips. His voice was deep, melodic — weaving tradition 
through every note. The kind of sound that didn’t ask for silence... it created it.

Liora walked near the center of the procession, her pace steady, her hands folded in prayer.

She had memorized every word of the hymn. She didn’t need to sing aloud. It was enough to 
think it, to feel it in her chest like a heartbeat. Her thoughts were clear: gratitude, hope, 
and trust. This was the moment she had prepared for. This was the walk that would change her 
daughter’s life for the better.

She didn’t notice her own hands were trembling.

Behind her, Elowen walked more slowly.

She held her satchel close to her chest, both arms wrapped around it tightly. Inside was the 
folded drawing — the girl in the stars — hidden between a scarf and a travel biscuit. 

She didn’t hum. She didn’t speak. Her eyes watched the backs of the people in front of her, 
but her thoughts were elsewhere.

Something about the sky felt... quiet in a different way. Not peaceful. Waiting.

At the head of the group, Elder Caelus walked with practiced formality. His staff tapped the stone 
path in precise rhythm. He did not sing.

He watched. He listened.

Whenever a whisper rose among the children, his gaze alone brought silence.

The gate of Auris faded into the trees behind them.

The road ahead stretched into the green hills, and far beyond them, the unseen place where 
the Star waited.

The walk had begun.
