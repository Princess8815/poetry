		<h1 class="short-title">Part 2: Mothers Hope – Liora</h1>

		<div class="short-text">

Liora stood beneath the colonnade just beyond the square, her hands clasped loosely at her waist.

The morning had passed in a hush of preparation. Shopkeepers swept their thresholds twice, 
just for the sake of the ritual’s tidiness. Elders had dusted the altar steps, and the 
town’s children — those who had reached their twelfth year — were quietly summoned home.

Sister Vessa, draped in the customary blue-gray of the Star’s service, approached 
with a familiar smile and a small nod.

“Liora,” she said, “I trust the preparations are going well?”

“As well as they can,” Liora replied, her voice polite and warm. “She’s excited. 
She’s been counting down since the spring equinox.”

“She knows tomorrow is important?”

“She does. She may be young, but she’s not unaware. I’ve told her it’s just a test — 
a gentle one — meant to help the elders understand her better.”

Vessa nodded. “And if there’s anything amiss, the Light will make it known. As it always does.”

Liora offered a thoughtful smile. “Of course. Though I have faith she will pass just fine.”

“She is your daughter, after all.”

Liora chuckled softly. “She’s bright. Curious. Talks too fast when she’s excited, but 
always means well. She has a good heart.”

“And a strong name,” Vessa added.

Liora beamed. “Elowen. It means elm tree — strong and growing. She’s both.”

“You must be proud.”

“I am,” Liora said, glancing toward the edge of the square. “I only want her to find her place.”

“That’s what the test is for,” Vessa said kindly, “To help her do exactly that.”

A bell tolled from the tower at the northern gate — a single chime, low and echoing.

Vessa bowed and began to depart with the other temple women. Liora remained still for a moment, 
watching the shadow of the bell tower stretch across the paving stones.

Then she turned, her voice soft but certain.

“Elowen!” she called into the garden path nearby, “Come along, love. It’s time to go.”
