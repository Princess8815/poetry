The testing chamber was colder than Elowen expected.

The walls were made of smooth white stone. No murals. No windows. Just a carved emblem of the Star 
above the door — watching.

Liora sat on a bench at the side, hands clasped tightly, her mouth pressed into a line. 
The other parents had already left. The tests were given one at a time. It was tradition.

Elder Caelus stood behind a small marble table, a stack of scrolls and a quill before him. 
His robes were immaculate. His expression was not unkind, but lacked softness.

“Name,” he said without looking up.

“Elowen,” she replied, standing perfectly still.

“Speak clearly.”

“Elowen,” she said again, louder.

Caelus nodded once. “We will begin.”

The test was not painful, but it felt wrong. It came in pieces — questions and tasks and quiet moments 
she did not understand.

“When someone cries, what do you do?”

“I’d ask them why.”

“No. You’re meant to comfort them. Immediately.”

“Oh. But... what if they don’t want that?”

Caelus made a mark on the scroll.

Later: “Which of these shapes is most pleasing?”

“They’re all different. I like how this one spins when you look at it too long.”

“That was not the question.”

Another mark.

She was asked to make eye contact and count backwards. Describe the feelings of a drawn face.  
Explain what a metaphor meant when read aloud. Touch fabric swatches and say which one was “too much.”

She hesitated.

“Too much... what?”

“Too much,” Caelus repeated.

Elowen looked to her mother, who smiled from the bench — small, proud, hopeful.

Caelus asked her to sit perfectly still and fold her hands.

She tried. But her fingers tapped her knees softly, trying to mimic the rhythm of the wind 
outside the chamber walls. She didn’t know why — it just felt like the room needed a song.

When the test ended, she was dizzy. Her hands were shaking. She blinked too fast.

Elder Caelus rose and turned to Liora.

“She carries the Curse,” he said plainly. “It has settled deeply.”

Liora gasped — a hand to her chest — and tears welled in her eyes.

But she was smiling.

“Thank the Light,” she whispered. “She will be guided. She will be healed.”

Elowen looked between them, her voice barely a breath.

“Did I do something wrong?”

Caelus was already rolling the scroll back into its case.
