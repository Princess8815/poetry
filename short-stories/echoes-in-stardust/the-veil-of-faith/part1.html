The village of Auris stirred with a sacred stillness.

Smoke curled from thatched chimneys as sunlight kissed the rooftops, casting 
shadows long and soft over quiet streets. Prayer chimes hung from doorframes, 
tinkling with the early breeze — their song light, hopeful.

Today was not a market day. It was not a festival. But it was a day of meaning.

It was the day the elders would announce the time of testing.

Each summer, those who had turned twelve — the age when the Curses first began 
to show — would undergo the trials of the Light. The tests, handed down through 
generations, would determine if the ancient burden stirred within them.

And if it did, they would walk the path.  
They would be guided to the Star.

In the central courtyard, families gathered with quiet smiles. Children stood tall, 
their tunics freshly pressed, their parents’ hands resting on their shoulders. 
Pride shimmered in their eyes. Nervous pride, yes — but pride all the same.

From the steps of the stone dais, Elder Mariun raised his arms.

He was a figure of reverence, his robes bright with sacred embroidery — each 
thread a prayer, each symbol a memory of those who had been cleansed before.

"The Season begins," he declared, his voice even and kind. "Let the Light fall upon 
us with grace. Let the tests reveal what is hidden, so that healing may begin."

A collective exhale passed through the crowd.

No one questioned the ritual. It had saved so many. The Cursed were not cast away 
— they were brought back whole. Freed from chaos, anchored in peace.

To be tested was not a sentence. It was a blessing.

And somewhere beyond the hills, hidden deep within the wilderness, the Star pulsed softly —  
a silent guardian, waiting to receive the chosen.
