		<h1 class="short-title">Part 3: Elowen Among the Leaves – Elowen</h1>

		<div class="short-text">
<pre>
Elowen crouched at the edge of the garden path, completely unaware she was being summoned.

Her fingers hovered just above the dirt, following the jagged trail left by a beetle. 
She wasn’t going to touch it — not today — but she liked the way it moved. Every now and then 
it paused, and she paused too, as if the two of them shared a secret rhythm only they could hear.

The elm tree above her swayed with the wind, its rustling leaves like applause. Elowen didn’t 
look up. She was humming — quietly, without knowing — a tune she claimed had “come from the air.”

“Just one more minute,” she whispered to the beetle.

In her small satchel were three leaves (each a different shape), two polished pebbles, 
and a scrap of parchment on which she had sketched a pattern she’d seen in her dreams — 
stars woven like vines, looping in impossible spirals.

Her sandals were on the wrong feet. Her sleeves were rolled unevenly. Her braids had begun 
to unravel hours ago.

When she finally stood at the sound of her mother’s voice, she didn’t brush off her dress. 
She didn’t check if anyone was watching.

She simply turned, wide-eyed, and beamed.

“I saw the same beetle from yesterday!” she announced before Liora could speak. 
“It made a new path today. It zigzagged instead of looping. I think it was in a hurry!”

Liora smiled gently. “I’m sure it was, love. But now it’s your turn to hurry.”

Elowen skipped toward her, then stopped halfway, her gaze caught by a shimmer of light on a nearby wall.

She squinted. “That window... it reflected a circle just now. But the sun’s behind the house.”

Her mother rested a hand on her shoulder. “You can tell me all about it on the way.”

Elowen didn’t argue. She never did. But she continued looking over her shoulder long after 
they’d started walking — not because she was nervous, but because she didn’t want to forget 
what she had seen.

There was always something to notice. Always something to remember.
