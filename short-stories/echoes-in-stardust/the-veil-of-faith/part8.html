Elowen sat beneath the elm tree in the golden light of late afternoon, drawing.

Her fingers, dark with smudged charcoal, moved slowly over parchment. A glowing figure had begun 
to take shape — a girl surrounded by stars, her arms open, her face gentle and strange. The sky 
around her pulsed with symbols and curves that made no earthly sense, but Elowen liked them anyway.

She wasn’t thinking hard. The lines just came.

Liora’s footsteps were soft as she approached from the garden path.

“Elowen,” she said, not unkindly. “It’s almost time to come in.”

Elowen looked up, then down at the parchment.

“I just wanted to finish her,” she said.

Liora crouched beside her, brushing a loose braid from her daughter’s cheek. Her eyes fell on the drawing.

The lines were beautiful. Flowing. Strange.

Too strange.

Liora smiled gently, but there was a sadness behind it. She rested a hand on Elowen’s back.

“Love… this is your Curse speaking.”

Elowen blinked. “What?”

“These pictures,” Liora said softly. “The way your mind makes shapes no one else sees. 
That’s the Curse. It fills your head with dreams that don’t make sense. They feel nice now, 
but they pull you away from the world. From others.”

Elowen looked down at the glowing girl in the stars.

“She doesn’t feel like a curse,” she whispered. “She feels... kind.”

“I know,” Liora said gently. “But that’s how it hides. The Star will help, sweetheart. 
After the walk, you’ll see the world more clearly. You won’t need these pictures anymore.”

Elowen didn’t speak.

Liora kissed the top of her head. “Come now. Let’s finish packing.”

Elowen folded the drawing and placed it carefully in her satchel, even though part of her 
feared she would never see the figure again.

She followed her mother without another word, feeling the weight of something she didn’t yet understand.
