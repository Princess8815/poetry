The verdict had been spoken, and the hall had emptied.

Outside, the town had gathered in the square. Fresh garlands were draped across pillars, 
and incense burned in shallow clay dishes — the scent of lavender and sunroot filling the air.

It was the eve of the Preparation Rite.

Liora and Elowen stood among the crowd, mother holding daughter’s hand tightly. 
Elowen’s fingers were limp in her palm. Her eyes drifted toward the clouds.

Elder Mariun stepped forward atop the ritual dais, robes glowing with golden thread, 
voice strong enough to silence the square with a single breath.

He spoke with practiced warmth, as though he had given this speech a thousand times 
and meant every word each time.

“Each generation is gifted with guardians of peace,” he began. “And each generation is 
burdened with those touched by the Curses. But the Star — blessed be Its Light — 
does not shun them.”

He turned slowly, arms outstretched.

“The Star welcomes them. Not to punish. Not to remove. But to refine.”

A priestess lifted a painted cloth high above her head — a depiction of the Star itself: 
a radiant orb surrounded by concentric rings of silver. It shimmered under the sun like water.

“The Star is a mirror,” Mariun continued. “A sacred flame. It shows us what must remain. 
And what must be burned away. It does not erase — it reveals.”

Liora’s eyes welled with quiet tears. Her heart swelled with a strange mix of pride and relief.  
Her daughter had been chosen. She would no longer have to carry her confusion alone.  
The Light would lift it. She would be made whole.

Elowen stared at the banner.

She tilted her head, as if trying to understand something just beyond the edges of the image.

“Why does it look sad?” she whispered.

Liora turned toward her. “What was that?”

Elowen blinked slowly. “Nothing.”

Mariun’s voice rose above the wind.

“The path begins soon. Be not afraid — for the Light does not fail.”

The crowd bowed in reverence. Liora followed without hesitation.

Elowen did not bow. Her eyes remained on the image of the Star, her mouth slightly open.

The painted eyes at the Star’s center glinted under the sun.

And for a moment, Elowen thought they blinked.
