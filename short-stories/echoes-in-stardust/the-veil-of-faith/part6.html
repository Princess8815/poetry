Liora folded Elowen’s ceremonial robe with careful hands. The fabric was soft and ivory, 
trimmed in gold thread. She smoothed each line twice, then again, as though each crease 
might carry weight on the path ahead.

The bundle of herbs was next — rosemary, basil, and blueleaf. All symbols of clarity and 
inner stillness. She pressed them into a small linen pouch and tied it shut with a braid of silver twine.

At her bedside, the prayer candle flickered low.

“Light within and Light without,” she murmured. “Burn away confusion. Guide the soul toward stillness. 
Let my daughter return whole.”

A rustle came from the corner.

Elowen sat cross-legged beside a cedar chest, its lid propped open. She had found a stack of yellowing pages, 
folded neatly beneath old festival robes and a ribbon of dried lavender.

Each page was covered in ink and charcoal — drawings that twisted and shimmered. 
Stars that merged into faces. Trees that grew from tears. Eyes with wings. Wings made of fire.

“These are beautiful,” Elowen said.

Liora turned. Her eyes softened, but her voice carried a note of finality.

“Those were your Aunt Neva’s. From before.”

Elowen blinked. “Before what?”

“Before the Cleansing.”

“Oh.”

“She made them during the height of her affliction,” Liora continued, returning to her folding. 
“The Curse often drives the mind into strange places. Some call it creativity, but it’s confusion. 
Pain. I kept them to remind myself what she overcame.”

Elowen traced a glowing sun with fingers smudged in charcoal dust. “But... how is this bad?”

“Because it’s not real,” Liora said. “It’s distorted. The Curse clouds your vision, love. 
You’ll understand when you’re cured. The world will feel clearer.”

Elowen didn’t answer.

She folded the page gently, as if tucking away a secret, and placed it back in the chest.

Her mother didn’t notice.

She was already lighting another candle.
