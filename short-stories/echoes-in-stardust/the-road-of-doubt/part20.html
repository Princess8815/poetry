Liora couldn’t sleep.

She sat near the dim coals of the fire, wrapping and unwrapping the same corner of her cloak, 
her mind spiraling in ways it hadn’t since she was a child.

Callix’s words wouldn’t leave her.  
“You were once like her.”

And something inside her believed it.

She waited until the others were quiet — then quietly approached Elder Mariun, who was seated 
beneath a pine, reading from a small, leather-bound tome.

“Elder,” she said, “may I ask something... personal?”

He looked up with measured calm. “Of course.”

“When I was young,” she began slowly, “was I... marked?”

He closed the book softly. His silence was answer enough.

“You walked this path,” he said. “Years ago.”

Liora swallowed. “Why don’t I remember?”

“It’s common. The Star takes the burden — memory is part of it. The transition must be clean.”

She sat beside him now, her voice steadier. “What was I like?”

He hesitated for only a breath.

“You were difficult to teach,” he said carefully. “Easily distracted. Unfocused. Loud.”

She blinked. “Did I… create things? Did I draw? Sing?”

Mariun didn’t respond at first.

Then, gently: “The Curse often masks itself in noise and color. But that doesn’t make it beautiful.”

Liora looked down. Her hands were trembling.

“Did I seem happy?”

He was quiet for too long.

Then: “It’s not wise to dwell on who we were. The Star shows us who we’re meant to be.”

She didn’t respond.

Mariun placed a hand on her shoulder. “We’ll reach the Star tomorrow.”

His voice softened — familiar, almost fatherly.

“Remember… the Star heals.”

Liora nodded, but didn’t look up.

The coals cracked softly beside them.

And the sky above was starless.
