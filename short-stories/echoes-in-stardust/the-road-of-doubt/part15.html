The stars were fading, the blue-gray edge of dawn creeping across the treetops.

Liora had hardly moved since she first sat. The children remained in their cluster, still whispering, still drawing, still dreaming.

No one told them to stop. And no one interrupted them.

Bram was holding a carving he’d shaped through the night — a tree with stars instead of leaves. 
He passed it to Mina, who turned it over once in her hands, then added it to the center of a spiral 
she’d etched into the ground.

Thyra began humming. Not a melody — just a rhythm. A pulse. A soft beat to accompany the shapes.

Elowen leaned over to whisper something, and all four of them giggled softly.

Liora’s gaze lingered.

They didn’t speak like other children. They didn’t behave the way she remembered behaving.  
But somehow… they understood each other completely.

From across the clearing, Delwin’s voice cut the quiet.

“He’s still at it,” he muttered, watching Bram from near the carts. “Stacking things. Sorting stones. 
Won’t even look at me when I speak.”

Aylin touched his arm. “He’s not trying to be difficult. It’s just… part of it.”

Delwin’s jaw tightened. “The Star will fix it. Just a little longer.”

Liora turned away before they could see her expression.

She rose slowly and made her way toward the edge of the clearing, where Elder Mariun stood surveying the path ahead.

He heard her approach and didn’t turn.

“They’ve been awake all night,” Liora said gently.

Mariun nodded. “It happens. Their minds rarely rest.”

“They seem happy,” she added, a little quieter.

His gaze narrowed, unreadable.

“Beauty is often the mask of chaos,” he said. “The Curse can create wonder. But it’s not truth. It’s distortion.”

She said nothing.

Mariun finally looked at her. “That’s why the ritual matters. To lift the veil. To restore what’s real.”

He turned, robes sweeping the ground, and walked toward the supply cart.

Behind Liora, Elowen and the others had begun gathering their bags, folding blankets, brushing ash from their drawings.

The morning was here.

Another clearing would need to be found. Another camp would need to be built before nightfall.

And the road — still long — waited in silence.
