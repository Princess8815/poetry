It was late.

Elowen had finally fallen asleep, curled beneath a spare blanket, her hand still loosely holding the edge of her satchel.

Liora sat near the edge of the clearing, eyes fixed on the shadows between the trees.

That’s when she heard it — not footsteps, not breathing — but *presence*.

“You were once like her.”

She turned.

A figure stood a few paces away, part of the dark, part of the forest. Wild gray curls spilled over his shoulders, 
and his eyes were sharp — too bright for someone so weathered.

“I—what?”

“You were bright once,” he said softly, almost like a lullaby. “You used to chase the wind. 
Used to hum the leaves into motion. They took that from you.”

Liora stiffened. “Who are you?”

He tilted his head. “Does it matter?”

A pause. Then, almost kindly:

“You don’t remember the ritual,” he continued. “None of us do. Not truly. But we feel what was taken.”

“You’re lying.”

“I’m surviving,” he replied.

Liora’s voice shook. “Why are you saying this to me?”

“Because you feel it,” he said. “You know something’s wrong. You were once *happy*.”

He pointed toward Elowen without raising his arm.

“Don’t let her walk the same path. She doesn’t need to be cured. She needs to be free.”

A crash of movement tore through the brush.

Elder Caelus emerged like a blade in motion, staff in hand. “Back!”

The man stepped back, raising his palms in surrender.

Caelus’s voice thundered. “You will not poison their faith!”

“I’m only giving them back what was taken,” the man said softly.

Caelus struck the ground with his staff. “Leave. Now.”

His eyes found Liora’s one last time.

“Remember who you were.”

Then he disappeared into the dark.

The clearing was still again — but the quiet felt heavier than before.

Liora stood frozen.

Her breath shallow.

Her voice, barely audible.

“…what did he mean?”

She looked toward the sleeping form of her daughter.

And for the first time, she didn’t know if she had the strength to look away.
