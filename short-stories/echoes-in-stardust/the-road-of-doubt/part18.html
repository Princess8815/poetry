The fire burned low.

Jori sat quietly at the edge of the circle, her hands folded in her lap, eyes fixed forward.

No one spoke to her. No one asked what she had seen. Even the elders were quiet.

Elowen hadn’t moved from Liora’s side.

She rested her head against her mother’s shoulder, fingers curled around the hem of Liora’s robe.

Her voice came softly — a breath more than a question.

“If the Star gives peace,” she said, “why does it take the parts that laugh?”

Liora closed her eyes.

She had answered so many questions in Elowen’s life. With warmth. With certainty.

This time, she said nothing.

Elowen turned to look up at her. “Do you think it’ll take mine?”

Liora’s mouth parted. No words came out.

Cressida’s voice broke the silence behind them.

Her tone was gentle. Almost kind. But her words carried an edge that didn’t soften.

“Doubt is the oldest whisper,” she said. “It sounds like love. It sounds like protection.”

Liora turned.

Cressida stood at the edge of the firelight, her hands clasped calmly, eyes unreadable.

“Even mothers can fall to it,” she continued. “That’s why we walk with the elders. So no one walks alone.”

She held Liora’s gaze for just a moment longer… then turned and disappeared into the trees.

Elowen’s fingers tightened around her mother’s robe.

Liora stared into the flames, her lips pressed in a line.

Still, she said nothing.
