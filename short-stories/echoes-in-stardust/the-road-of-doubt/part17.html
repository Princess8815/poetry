The morning air was crisp, touched with dew and silence.

The children were just beginning to stir when Jori bounded through the campsite, arms flapping excitedly, 
babbling to herself in bursts of fragmented thought.

“There’s color in the smoke—did you see it? Not gray, it was purple for a second—then it turned into a fish—"

She darted from tree to tree, stopping mid-sentence to crouch beside a mushroom or point at nothing at all.

Some children smiled. Some didn’t know how to respond.

“She’s too much,” muttered Delwin under his breath.

Liora frowned but said nothing.

Elder Caelus stepped forward from the treeline. He watched Jori closely, not unkindly, but without warmth.

He raised his hand, and the campsite fell still.

“This journey is sacred,” he said calmly. “Each step brings understanding. The walk is not just to reach the Star — 
it is to witness its mercy in our own time.”

He turned to face the group.

“But now and then, a child bears the Curse with uncommon weight. And for them... waiting is cruel.”

He placed a hand on Jori’s shoulder.

“She is one such child.”

A quiet murmur spread through the group.

Caelus looked to the other elders. “I will take her ahead. We will rejoin you by nightfall. You all may rest here today.”

“But she hasn’t walked the full path,” Liora said before she could stop herself.

Caelus nodded once. “She doesn’t need to. The Star’s glory is not diminished by urgency. The longer walk is for those 
who require time to understand. For her... understanding is already lost in the storm.”

Jori looked up at him. “Do stars blink even when we don’t look?”

He didn’t answer. He just guided her gently into the trees.

Elowen took Liora’s hand. “Why today?” she whispered. “She wasn’t ready.”

Liora had no answer.

The day passed in uneasy silence. No fire was built. No games were played.

When Caelus returned before sunset, Jori walked beside him — her hands still, her face blank, her steps slow and even.

She said nothing.

Not a single outburst. No stimming. No words about stars or smoke or colors.

She folded her blanket carefully. Ate without a word. Sat with her legs crossed, eyes vacant but obedient.

“She’s so calm,” someone whispered.

“She’s better now,” another said.

But Elowen stared at her for a long time, then turned and buried her face in Liora’s side.

“She’s not smiling,” she whispered.

Liora rested her hand on Elowen’s back.

Her other hand trembled in her lap.
