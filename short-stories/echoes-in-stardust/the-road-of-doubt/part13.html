Elowen sat near the edge of the firelight, knees tucked to her chest.

Most of the other children had drifted closer to their parents, huddled beneath blankets, 
quiet and tired. Soft snoring rose from a few bundles. Others whispered familiar prayers. 
The adults nearby spoke low and slow, their words blending into the steady crackle of the fire.

But just beyond the main circle, past the first line of trees, were a few children who didn’t seem tired at all.

One of them was a boy seated on a flat stone, carefully arranging carved wooden figures in a row.  
His movements were deliberate — one piece at a time, each placed with perfect spacing.  
A bird with spiral wings. A house with too many doors. A tower leaning slightly to the left.

He didn’t speak. But when he saw Elowen watching, he pushed the bird toward her — slowly, gently.

She scooted closer, her eyes wide. “Did you make these?”

He nodded.

“What’s this one?” she asked, picking up the tower.

He didn’t answer, but slid over a figure shaped like a tiny person with a crown.  
Then he took the tower back and placed the crowned figure beside it.

“Oh,” Elowen said, smiling. “She lives there?”

The boy gave the smallest smile, then reached into his pouch and pulled out a new block of wood.  
Without a word, he began carving again — chips falling at his feet like curls of cinnamon bark.

A few paces behind him, a girl was walking in tight, slow circles, her hands floating just above the ground.  
She wasn’t picking anything up. Just tracing shapes into the air with her fingers — spirals, angles, loops.  
Every now and then, she paused mid-step and stared straight into the branches above, her head tilting sharply.  
Then she would turn again and start her pattern from a different direction.

“They blink between the branches,” she said aloud.

Elowen looked up. “What does?”

“The lights. The pieces of the sky. You have to squint sideways to catch them.”

Elowen did.

She didn’t see anything.

But she wished she did.

“I’m Elowen,” she said softly.

The girl blinked several times and smiled wide. “Thyra.”

Thyra took Elowen’s hand and led her in a half-circle around the fire.  
“Try it this way. It’s easier if you hum something without knowing what it means.”

“I do that,” Elowen whispered.

Thyra nodded like she already knew.

They sat together in the leaves, their hands drawing shapes that didn’t have names.

Not far away, crouched near the roots of an old pine, another girl sat alone.

She was older — maybe thirteen — and she hadn’t spoken once, not even during prayer.  
Her fingers were coated in ash, and she was drawing in the dirt with quiet intensity.

Elowen and Thyra stepped closer.

A trail of shapes unfolded across the ground — stars bending into waves, waves 
falling into a waterfall, and there, in the center of the cascade, a girl stood holding a glowing thread.  
No faces. No words. But everything in the picture was alive.

The girl didn’t look up when they approached. She just kept drawing.

“What’s her name?” Elowen asked, kneeling beside the picture.

The girl didn’t answer.

But she smiled.

Thyra nudged Elowen’s arm. “That’s Mina. She doesn’t talk. But she’s always telling stories.”

Elowen sat down cross-legged in the dirt beside her.

She reached into her satchel and slowly pulled out her folded parchment — the drawing she’d made.  
The girl in the stars. The open arms. The light.

She didn’t show it. Not yet. But her fingers rested on the edges, knowing it was there.

A voice called softly across the clearing.

“Elowen?” It was her mother.

Liora had sat up from her bedroll, rubbing her eyes. “Come rest, love. We have another long day ahead.”

Elowen hesitated, glancing at the children still scattered in their quiet worlds.

Then she stood, brushing off the dirt, and followed her mother back toward the firelight.

The drawing stayed in her hand.
