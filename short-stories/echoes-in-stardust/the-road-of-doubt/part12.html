By the time the sun began to dip behind the canopy, the procession had slowed.

The path had narrowed to a trail, winding through tall pines and thick ferns. Roots 
stretched across the dirt like veins, forcing even the elders to step carefully.

At a bend in the trail, Elder Mariun raised his hand.

“This is where we rest,” he called out.

They entered a clearing shaped like a bowl, lined with moss and half-ringed by stone. 
It was one of the sacred campsites — Liora had seen it in a book as a girl. She recognized 
the carvings in the standing stones, faint but still visible. Runes for balance. For silence. 
For surrender.

Parents began laying out bedrolls. Children were directed toward the fire pit. 
Incense pouches were passed from pack to pack, lit one by one.

Liora knelt immediately near the western stone and began her prayers without hesitation. 
Her voice was low and measured, joining the quiet harmony of the other parents who gathered near.

Elowen sat at first, but her eyes strayed — not in boredom, but in quiet fascination.

A line of ants moved like dancers up the bark of a nearby tree, weaving between patches 
of peeling bark. A squirrel darted through the leaves above, its paws stirring petals from 
a branch that had no flowers.

She stood up, drawn by nothing and everything.

“Little one,” came a voice behind her, soft but direct.

Elowen turned to see a girl not much older than her mother — dressed in ceremonial gray, 
marked by a silver-threaded sash and the emblem of the Star.

The young woman smiled gently. “Where are you going?”

“I just wanted to see that tree,” Elowen said.

“We stay together during prayer,” the woman replied. “My name is Cressida. I help the 
elders guide the children.”

Her voice was kind, but it carried weight. Elowen nodded and followed her back to the ring of prayer.

At the edge of the fire circle, Liora rose to greet her.

She placed both hands on Elowen’s shoulders and recited the Blessing of the Path.

“You are not lost,” she whispered. “You are walking home.”

Elowen didn’t resist. But as she sat again, her gaze drifted back toward the trees.

The prayers continued behind her.

But in the space between each word, the forest made its own sound.
