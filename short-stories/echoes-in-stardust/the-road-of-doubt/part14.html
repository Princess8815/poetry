The morning sun filtered through the trees in long golden beams.

Liora folded Elowen’s robe in slow, careful motions. The lines had to be even. 
The symbol facing out. Her hands paused once, then resumed.

Elowen sat a short distance away, her fingers tracing the ridges of a pinecone like 
a puzzle only she could see.

“She’s been sitting like that for some time,” came a voice behind her.

Liora turned to see Elder Caelus, arms crossed, gaze steady.

“She likes patterns,” Liora said. “Always has.”

Caelus nodded. “It’s one of the signs. Fixation. Disrupted attention balance.”

He gestured subtly to Bram, who sat cross-legged in the dirt, carving a curved feather 
from a piece of birch. “That boy — he hasn’t spoken since the spring. His father says 
he used to hum constantly, then nothing. He’s stuck in his head.”

“His carvings are beautiful,” Liora offered.

“They’re coping mechanisms. The Curse disorients the mind, so they create rhythm. It gives 
the illusion of clarity.”

He glanced toward Thyra. “The girl who traces stars during daylight. Sensory flooding. 
She doesn’t filter what she sees. Everything comes in at once.”

“And Elowen?” Liora asked, quieter now.

Caelus gave the smallest smile. “Still herself. Just... misaligned.”

He didn’t linger after that. He bowed slightly, then moved on.

Liora remained where she stood, robe still folded in her hands.

That evening, after dinner, the children gathered beneath the stars again.

No prayers were said — not formal ones. Just quiet conversations, soft laughter, 
and the sound of Mina’s fingers dragging a new story through the earth.

Elowen tilted her head toward the sky. “That one looks like it’s holding a secret.”

Thyra nodded. “That one’s a keyhole.”

Bram passed her a small carving shaped like a spiral. He didn’t speak, but his eyes were warm.

Mina’s fingers danced faster, a constellation of symbols blooming at her knees.

Liora watched from the edge of the firelight.

She meant to begin her evening prayer.

But for some reason, her lips didn’t move right away.
