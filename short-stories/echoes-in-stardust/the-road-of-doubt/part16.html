They walked most of the day.

The forest shifted around them — trees growing taller, older, closer. The path narrowed 
to single file more than once. Packs grew heavier. Even the songs faded from Elder Mariun’s lips 
by the afternoon.

Elowen stayed near the back, her feet dragging slightly, her satchel bumping her side 
in a steady rhythm.

No one complained, but the silence had grown heavier.

By early evening, they reached another sacred rest ground — a hollow circled by old stones 
and soft moss. The clearing smelled of lavender and pine.

Tents and blankets were unpacked without ceremony. Firewood was gathered. Water was boiled.

When the stars began to appear, the children drifted toward one another.  
The adults lingered near the flames, shoulders drooping, hands resting still.

Liora sat with Elowen at her side. Her fingers traced the edge of a wooden spoon. 
She didn’t speak for a long while.

Then, quietly — as if telling the air instead of the people — she said,  
“My sister used to sing louder than the bells.”

A few heads turned. Others just listened.

“She would paint on the walls when no one was looking. Stars. Dragons. Faces that didn’t exist.  
Once she painted a map she said came from her dreams. It didn’t lead anywhere, but she followed it for a week.”

Elowen looked up. “Was that Aunt Neva?”

Liora nodded.

“She made puppets out of paper and put on plays where everyone cried, even when it was supposed to be funny.  
She built a sculpture out of spoons once. My mother was furious.”

A quiet chuckle from someone across the fire.

“She talked too fast. Laughed too loud. And when she was excited, she’d pace in circles and list facts 
about the moon for hours. The elders said she was... overwhelmed. Marked.”

Elowen was watching closely now.

“After the ritual,” Liora said, her voice quieter, “she spoke less. But she was calm. Clear. She started baking.  
She smiles at everyone now. People say she’s doing well.”

Elowen hugged her knees. Her voice was small.

“Does she still paint?”

Liora shook her head.

“Does she still sing?”

“No.”

The fire cracked softly.

Elowen lowered her head. “Would she have still smiled if they didn’t take her voice?”

A long pause.

No one answered.

A few of the other parents shifted uncomfortably. Delwin looked toward the trees.

Elowen’s voice barely carried, but it landed like a stone in still water.

“I don’t want to be like Neva.”

Liora said nothing.

She only reached over and tucked a blanket around her daughter’s legs, hands pausing just briefly 
before pulling away.
