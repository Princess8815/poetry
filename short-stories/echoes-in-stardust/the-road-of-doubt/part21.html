Liora slept, but not deeply.

Her brow furrowed. Her body twitched. Her fingers clenched around the blanket.

And in her sleep, the dream came.

She stood in a sun-drenched clearing, barefoot and spinning, her arms outstretched.

Laughter poured from her lips — full, loud, bright. She couldn’t have been more than ten.

Paint streaked her fingertips. Her dress was covered in stars she had drawn herself.

Around her, ribbons of wind danced through tall flowers. The world shimmered with motion.

Then — silence.

A bell tolled.

She turned — and saw figures cloaked in gray.

Their hands reached for her, not cruelly, but firmly.

She backed away.

“No,” her voice said — not the adult voice she knew, but her child’s voice. “Please. I’m not ready.”

They didn’t stop.

Behind them, a great light pulsed.

She turned again — and saw *herself*.

The adult Liora, frozen, unable to move. Watching.

The girl-child reached toward her, tears on her cheeks.

“Please,” she whispered. “Remember me.”

Liora tried to run to her, to hold her, but her legs wouldn’t move.

The child faded, swallowed by the light.

And then, a new image:

Elowen.

Taken by the same cloaked hands. Her eyes dull. Her smile gone.

Her drawing fell from her fingers. The wind carried it away.

Liora screamed — but no sound came.

The dream cracked.

The stars above blinked open like eyes.

And the voice came again, soft and feminine — like wind through leaves, like the voice of something old and kind.

“Please… remember me.”

Liora jolted awake.

The fire was almost out.

Her breath came in gasps. Her face was damp with sweat.

She sat up, staring into the darkness.

Just beyond the firelight, Elowen sat awake, whispering a tune into her palms.

Bram, Thyra, and Mina were near her — huddled together, eyes wide but not afraid.

They looked up at the stars.

And for just a moment…

It felt like the stars were looking back.
