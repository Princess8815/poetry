The cobblestone road gave way to dirt by midmorning.

Where once the trees stood politely at the edge of town, they now leaned overhead, 
branching thick and high like clasped hands above the procession. The air was cooler here, 
thick with moss and quiet birdsong.

Liora walked with her chin high and her steps measured. She had memorized the order of 
procession: elders first, then families by age, then children last. She had studied the 
Route of Renewal as a child and knew every turning path.

Still, something about the trees unnerved her. She clutched her daughter’s token in her 
pocket, fingers grazing the carved bark again and again.

Faith, she reminded herself. Faith is a path. And she would walk it.

Behind her, Elowen’s gaze flitted through the branches, not in fear — but fascination.

The way light split through the leaves reminded her of the shape of the drawing in her bag. 
She tilted her head, letting the sounds of the forest wash over her.

She began to hum. Softly. Not the hymns they had learned — something else.

It had rhythm. It had shape. But it didn’t have a name.

“Elowen,” Liora said quietly without turning. “Keep your voice down.”

The girl stopped humming, but the song stayed in her head like a heartbeat.

At the front of the line, Elder Mariun murmured lines of a walking psalm:  
“Step by step, we shed the storm. Step by step, we shape the soul.”

His voice was low, melodic, meant to calm.

Beside him, Elder Caelus did not speak. He only glanced back every few minutes, 
watching the group like a shepherd watches sheep.

When two younger children whispered, he raised a single finger to his lips.  
They fell silent instantly.

The families walked in clusters. Some spoke in hushed tones, some not at all. 
Most looked forward, but some — mostly the children — looked everywhere else.

The town was behind them now. The road ahead narrowed.

And the trees… only grew taller.
