Liora lay still.

The world had gone white, and in the silence that followed, she saw something she hadn’t seen in decades.

A girl — spinning barefoot in a field of wildflowers, dress covered in stardust-colored scribbles.

Paint smeared her cheeks. Ribbons tangled in her hair. She laughed so loudly it made the clouds blush.

The girl turned.

She looked straight at Liora.

"You remembered me,” the girl whispered.

"You can still save her. It’s not too late.”

Liora stumbled forward in the vision, her chest aching.

"Who were you?" she asked. But she already knew.

She was *herself*. Before the silence. Before the Star.

And just as suddenly as it began — the image shattered.

Liora awoke with a gasp.

She sat up.

The clearing was quiet.

Too quiet.

The children stood in a circle again, perfectly spaced, perfectly still. Their eyes blank. Their expressions calm.

Elowen turned.

Her smile was hollow.

“Mommy,” she said softly. “Everything is fine now.”

Liora’s heart twisted.

She crawled to her daughter, gripping her arms.

“Elowen… what do you feel?”

“I feel peaceful,” Elowen said, emotionless.

Her drawing lay on the ground behind her — torn, crumpled, forgotten.

Liora stood, trembling.

"No," she said. "No, this isn’t right."

Mariun stepped forward, robes flawless, voice composed.

“She is healed.”

“She was never broken,” Liora growled. “She was joyful. She was alive. And you took that.”

“She is at peace,” he repeated, unmoved.

Liora’s eyes locked on the Star.

The staff used to complete the ritual still jutted from its core.

The glow had dimmed. It was flickering — *failing*.

Without a word, Liora ran.

“Stop her!” Caelus shouted, but no one moved.

She reached the Star, grabbed the staff, and *ripped it free*.

Then, with a cry of rage and grief — she slammed it into the base of the obelisk.

A sharp crack echoed.

The Star split.

Its light flickered violently, and a pulse burst outward in a wave.

Mariun screamed.

His voice warped — deeper, older, *inhuman*.

“You dare!”

His face twisted — once serene, now monstrous. Horns flickered into view. His mouth split into rows of jagged teeth.

“You ruined everything!”

The other elders stepped back, horror dawning across their faces.

Even Cressida whispered, “What is he?”

Mariun's voice tore the sky.

“I *fed* on their silence! I *thrived* on their surrender! I *shaped* your obedience!”

He turned on Liora, eyes glowing crimson.

“I knew you would resist. I should have ended you with the others. But better late than never.”

He raised a hand. The air darkened.

“You will not leave this place.”

And behind him—

The Star trembled.
