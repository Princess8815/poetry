The clearing was no longer silent.

Parents stood — not with obedience, but with hesitation. A few stepped protectively in front of their children.

Delwin had both arms around Bram now. Aylin clutched Thyra’s hand. Another mother wrapped her scarf 
around Mina’s shoulders, shielding her.

“This isn’t right,” someone whispered. “They're just children.”

Mariun’s eyes darkened. “The Curse manipulates love. It makes you see beauty in chaos.”

Liora faced him fully. “Then maybe chaos deserves to be seen.”

The tension snapped like a bowstring.

Across the clearing, the children who remained had not scattered. They hadn’t run.

They had joined hands.

And they were humming.

Soft. Slow. Familiar.

It was the tune Elowen whispered beneath the stars.

Bram’s lips moved soundlessly. Thyra traced spirals in the air. Mina’s fingers danced across her palm.

The sound grew louder — not their voices, but the ground.

The Star pulsed — once, hard.

A vibration rolled through the soil. Moss lifted in waves. The obelisk began to glow brighter — not warm, not radiant.  
Unstable. Flickering.

Mariun turned toward the artifact with urgency. “Silence them,” he hissed.

Cressida stepped forward, her voice trembling. “This is... it’s reacting.”

“It *feels* the infection,” Mariun snapped. “It knows the ritual is threatened.”

A few parents tried to calm the children. Others did nothing. One man fell to his knees and began to weep.

Liora moved to speak—then stopped.

The trees behind them rustled.

Heavy steps.

Caelus burst into the clearing, robes torn, staff in hand. His jaw was set, his expression cold with fury.

He dragged Elowen forward by the wrist. Mina stumbled beside her. Bram and Thyra were pushed from behind.

“They resisted,” Caelus growled. “They tried to hide.”

He threw a glare toward Liora and Delwin.

“Enough.”

His voice shook the space.

“This Curse will be removed from these children,” he said. “With or without your help.”
