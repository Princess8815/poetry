Mariun’s true form loomed over the broken circle.

The skin of his illusion peeled away — bone-white horns, eyes like open wounds, black smoke rolling from his mouth.

The parents had formed a wall in front of the children. Their fear was still there — but so was their courage.

Cressida stood beside Liora now, visibly shaken. Her voice wavered. “You... were never a guide.”

Mariun grinned, sharp and wide.

“You fools. Do you think you've won anything?”

Behind him, the Star cracked again. Light sputtered out in bursts. It was failing — and he knew it.

He turned slowly to face the crowd.

“I built this Star so the world could be *silent*.”

He lifted his clawed hand toward the sky, as if summoning the void itself.

“You worshipped it. You brought your children willingly. I fed on what made them whole — and you called it peace.”

The wind howled. Stones lifted from the ground and hovered, trembling.

Mariun's voice deepened — dark and melodic.

“You have not won. This world *will* be silent. They *will* conform. I will *rebuild it all*, and next time…  
no one will remember joy.”

Liora stepped forward, her fists clenched, her voice unshaken.

“No. You won’t.”

Mariun roared — and lunged at her.

A blinding flash split the air.

A figure appeared between them — faceless, radiant, wings like shattered crystal, cloaked in flowing silver.

The blow struck the figure square in the chest.

A deep wound opened — black fire burned through starlight — but they did not fall.

They stood.

Between Liora and the demon.

And Mariun… took a step back.

The Star behind them cracked once more.
