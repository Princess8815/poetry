The Star had grown louder.

Not in sound — but in presence. Its hum had deepened, resonating in the soil, in the stones, in their bones.

The children were gathered in a half-circle around it. None of them spoke.

Elder Cressida stood in the center now — her arms raised, her robes fanned around her like wings.  
She chanted in a language no one recognized, each word rising and falling in tempo with the pulsing of the Star.

With every syllable, her eyes glowed — faint, silver, like moonlight caught in frost.

Liora sat behind the children with the other parents, her hands resting on her lap.

She couldn’t feel them.

They had gone numb.

The sacred scarf for Elowen’s shoulders lay draped across her knees. The ceremonial belt hung loose in her fingers.

She looked down at them. At her hands.

They were trembling.

She forced a smile onto her lips and turned to her daughter. “Come here, love. Let me get this on you.”

Elowen stepped forward slowly, her eyes flickering between Liora and the Star.

She held her drawing close — creased now, faded, worn soft at the edges.

Liora began to dress her in silence, folding the scarf gently over her shoulders, tying the belt with a shaking knot.

She tried to hum a familiar tune — one from Elowen’s childhood — but the notes caught in her throat and vanished.

Elowen’s voice was a whisper, almost lost beneath the chant.

“I don’t want to forget who I am.”

Liora’s hands stopped.

She looked into her daughter’s eyes — wide, glassy, full of everything she was afraid to say.

The chanting continued. The Star pulsed.

“I don’t want to forget the stars I saw,” Elowen whispered. “Or the stories I made. Or the way Mina laughs without sound.”

Liora reached up and cupped her face.

Her own smile cracked, tears pressing into her eyes.

“You won’t,” she said, barely a breath. “You won’t forget.”

But the Star hummed louder.

And behind them, Cressida’s voice echoed across the stones.

“Step forward, children of the Light. The cleansing begins.”
