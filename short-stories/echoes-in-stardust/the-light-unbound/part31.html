Stardust lifted her head.

Her voice was soft, but it carried into every soul.

"The world… was once filled with color. With laughter. With music made by hands that trembled and voices that cracked.  
It was loud — but in a way that felt like celebration.”

She smiled, though her face was tired.

“I was a guardian of that freedom. A protector of chaos and beauty. But he feared it.  
The demon wanted silence — and so he trapped me here.”

Her gaze dropped to the cracked obelisk beside her.

“He used my power. Twisted it. Built this Star to drain the voices of those who dared to be different.  
Those who didn’t follow his idea of ‘peace.’ The dreamers. The artists. The joyful.  
He didn’t just take their words. He stole their presence — their fire — their *existence*.”

Liora stepped forward, Elowen beside her, hand in hand.

“I don’t know what to do now,” Liora said quietly. “I’ve lived by rules. By rituals. I believed in order.  
Without it… where do we go?”

Stardust looked at her — truly looked — and her eyes shimmered with galaxies.

“That’s the beauty of freedom,” she said. “You’ll always find a way.  
There’s an infinite world ahead of you. Let it be messy. Let it be different. Let it be *real*.”

She turned to the children, to the parents, to the sky.

“Embrace difference. Embrace your voice. You have it back now.”

And with that — she began to fade.

Not violently. Not in sorrow.

She became light — rising gently, unraveling into the wind like stars returning home.

---

They returned to the town as dawn touched the rooftops.

It was not the town they had left.

No longer did children march in perfect rows. No longer did silence hang like fog.

The town was singing.

Wind chimes clattered without rhythm. Paint splashed across doors. People danced without coordination,  
laughed in unexpected ways, and shouted joyfully at nothing in particular.

Not everyone was loud — but no one was muted.

They weren’t cursed.

They never were.

They were simply — finally — allowed to *be*.

And the stars above, for the first time in generations, were watching…

with joy.
