The morning came slow and gray.

No birdsong greeted them. Just a hush that felt too deliberate.

Liora woke with her heart still racing from the dream. The voice still echoed faintly in her chest:
*Please… remember me.*

Elowen was already awake, sitting up and clutching her satchel like armor.

Bram, Thyra, and Mina hadn’t said a word.

The elders moved differently now — fewer words, sharper glances. The time for comfort had passed.

They broke camp quickly. There was no breakfast, just water and silence. Cressida handed out folded scarves  
dyed with the symbol of the Star. No one asked what they were for.

By midmorning, they walked.

The trail curved and narrowed as trees thinned into high rock outcroppings.

The ground grew pale beneath their feet — a chalky white soil that glowed faintly beneath patches of moss.

Every step forward felt heavier. Not from exhaustion. From knowing.

They crested a final hill.

And there it was.

A vast clearing wrapped in silver-leafed trees, stone columns half-buried in moss, and in the center...

The Star.

A towering obelisk, smooth and black, shot through with glowing opal veins. Its surface was etched with spirals  
and symbols that twisted just beyond recognition. It didn’t reflect light. It drank it.

A low hum pulsed from its core. Not a sound. A *feeling* — like something alive... and watching.

Liora stopped walking. Her eyes widened.

She had imagined something holy. But this was something else.

Elowen froze beside her.

She whispered, “It’s too quiet.”

Liora looked at her. “What do you mean?”

“I don’t know,” Elowen whispered. “But it feels like it’s waiting.”

She pulled her drawing from her satchel and held it close.

At the base of the clearing, the elders were already moving.

Cressida spread sacred cloth over the altar stones. Mariun passed through the children, brushing a mark of oil  
on each forehead.

“You’ve walked well,” he said to each one. “You are seen. You are ready.”

Caelus paced near the tree line, staff in hand.

“No speaking. No questions,” he said, his voice clipped. “We begin preparations now.”

The group settled.

No laughter. No prayers.

Just the hum of the Star.

Liora stepped forward again, but her legs felt like stone.

She looked at Elowen, who hadn’t moved — her eyes fixed on the Star, her fingers trembling.

And Liora realized...

It wasn’t just the silence.

It was the feeling that something had already begun.
