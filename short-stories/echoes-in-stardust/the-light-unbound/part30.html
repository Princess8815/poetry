Mariun lunged again — a final blow, drenched in fury.

But the radiant being lifted their hand.

A burst of silver light exploded outward, catching the demon mid-step and hurling him across the clearing.

He vanished in a streak of shadow and ash.

The air fell still.

Then the being collapsed.

Their knees hit the earth with a dull, heavy thud. Their wings dimmed. Their breathing was ragged.

Liora ran, not to the being — but to Elowen.

Her daughter still stood in the circle of light, quiet, expression blank.

“Please,” Liora whispered, grabbing her shoulders. “Come back to me.”

Elowen blinked. “Why are you crying?”

“Because you’re not *you*,” Liora said, choking on her words. “Because I remember your laugh. Your stories.  
The way you talked about stars like they were your friends.”

She shook her gently. “Please remember.”

“I feel calm,” Elowen said, uncertain. “Isn’t that good?”

“No,” Liora said, tears falling freely now. “You were never meant to be *calm*. You were meant to be free.”

Silence.

Then — Elowen’s breath hitched.

She blinked again.

Her hands reached up and touched her face, confused by the tears now falling from her own eyes.

“I… drew a girl,” she whispered. “She lived in the stars…”

Liora broke.

She pulled her daughter close, weeping into her hair.

“I remember,” Elowen whispered. “I remember everything.”

They held each other.

Around them, the other children began stirring.

Something was changing.

Elowen looked toward the center of the clearing. “Mama… that light… she’s still there.”

Liora turned.

The being still knelt where the Star had stood, wings trailing behind like torn silk, glowing faintly.

Liora approached slowly, reverently.

The being looked up, her face bloodied but serene.

Her voice, though soft, echoed through the stones.

“My name… is Stardust.”

“I am an angel, trapped here for centuries… bound by him.”

Liora knelt beside her, breath held.

Stardust looked into her eyes, and something ancient stirred behind hers.

“And now, you must know the truth of all this—”
