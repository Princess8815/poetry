Elowen didn’t move.

The other children began stepping forward, slow and hesitant, guided by Mariun’s soft voice.

But Elowen stayed where she was, her fingers locked tightly around Mina’s hand.

Cressida’s chant faltered slightly.

Elder Caelus’s head turned sharply. “Child,” he said, “step forward.”

Elowen’s voice cracked. “No.”

Gasps rippled from the seated parents. The Star pulsed once, brighter.

“She’s frightened,” Liora said quickly, rising. “Just give her a moment—”

“She must walk,” Caelus interrupted. “Now.”

Elowen’s hands were shaking. “I don’t want to forget,” she said again, louder this time. “I don’t want to be empty.”

Tears streamed down her face.

Caelus stepped forward. “If she will not come, we will bring her. The Curse always resists. It tries to survive.”

Mariun spoke gently, “This is not new. It happens every year. Parents — please — calm your children.  
Hold them, if needed. Help them complete the path.”

Several parents stood uncertainly.

Bram took a step back.

Thyra covered her ears.

Mina gripped Elowen’s arm tighter and didn’t let go.

“Liora,” Caelus said firmly, “she is yours. Bring her to the Star.”

Liora moved — not toward Elowen, but in front of her.

She placed herself between her daughter and the elders. Her breath shook, but she stood tall.

“She isn’t hurting anyone,” Liora said. “She laughs. She draws. She sings.”

“She’s happy.”

Caelus narrowed his eyes. “Happiness can be a symptom of confusion. The Curse can feel—”

“No,” Liora cut him off. Her voice cracked. “This isn’t right.”

She turned to Elowen.

“Elowen — go.”

Elowen blinked. “What?”

“Run,” Liora said, louder now. “Go. Take Mina. Go now.”

Elowen didn’t wait. She turned, pulled Mina with her, and ran.

Cressida stepped forward in shock. “Stop them!”

But Liora didn’t move to help.

She stared down the elders, her chest rising and falling with each breath.

“This is not right.”
