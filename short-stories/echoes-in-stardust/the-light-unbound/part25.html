One of the elders — Caelus — broke from the circle and bolted after the fleeing children.

His robes tore through the underbrush. His voice echoed, sharp and commanding:  
“Stop! You will endanger everyone!”

Liora didn’t chase. She only turned and took a single step back — just enough to see Elowen vanish beyond the trees.

A circle of gasps erupted behind her.

A few parents rose to their feet. Some clutched their children. Others turned on Liora with wide, panicked eyes.

“You don’t understand,” one mother whispered. “That was the Curse speaking. You can’t let it root in them.”

“This is part of it,” said another. “It always resists. It *always* fights back before it’s healed.”

Liora shook her head.

“It’s not resisting,” she said, her voice raw. “It’s *living*.”

Delwin stepped forward, his arms around Bram’s shoulders. Aylin stood beside him, pale, torn.

“She was smiling yesterday,” Liora continued. “They all were. They shared stories. They made each other laugh.  
They weren’t broken — they were *alive*.”

“She’s cursed,” someone said again. “She’ll forget how to think clearly. She’ll wander. She’ll become unsafe.”

“Unsafe to who?” Liora shouted. “To you? To the elders? Or just to the idea you were told to believe?”

No one answered.

“I’ve been where she is. I didn’t know it until now, but I *was her*. And I was taken.”

She looked at each of them — her voice cracking, her tears falling openly.

“I don’t remember who I was before the Star. But I remember this: I used to feel... more.  
And that was taken. Quietly. Gently. Permanently.”

Delwin looked down at Bram, who was now holding Thyra’s hand.

Aylin bit her lip, torn, trembling.

Liora stepped forward again.

“We don't need the Star. We need to *see* each other. As we are. Not as what they tell us to fear.”

A heavy silence filled the clearing.

Then — the slow, deliberate sound of footsteps.

Elder Mariun emerged from the trees, robes untouched by dust, his hands folded neatly.

He looked calm. He always looked calm.

But something in his eyes had gone dark.

“You risk more than just your soul,” he said.

Liora didn’t flinch.

Mariun stepped forward, voice like velvet over glass.

“This is not your daughter speaking,” he said. “This is the Curse.”

His eyes narrowed — steady, unreadable.

“This is the Curse speaking.”
