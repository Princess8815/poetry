The Star cracked.

A thin fracture split down its face — not clean, not quiet.

The hum became a shriek.

Light poured from within, but it wasn’t warm. It flickered wildly, pulsing like a heartbeat torn out of time.

Elowen screamed. She dropped to her knees, hands clamped over her ears.

“It hurts!” she sobbed. “It’s not light—it’s *screaming*! It’s screaming!”

Liora rushed to her side, shielding her with her body.

“Stop!” she shouted at the elders. “Stop this!”

They didn’t.

Mariun and Caelus stood at either side of the obelisk, chanting louder, trying to drown out the sound.

Parents clutched their children. Some began to cry. Others started shouting — *pleading* — for it to end.

Cressida staggered backward, clutching her head.

“No—no—it’s not supposed to be this loud—”

She collapsed to the stones.

Caelus reached for her, but Liora was faster.

She lunged forward, grabbed Cressida’s staff—and *snapped* it over her knee.

The crack of wood echoed like thunder.

Mariun’s eyes widened. “You dare—!”

“I will not let you destroy them!” Liora shouted.

Caelus roared and raised his own staff—but Delwin tackled him before he could swing.

Two more parents rushed to hold Mariun back—but he threw them off with surprising strength.

Mariun's voice twisted. “I’ll finish it myself!”

He seized the remaining staff — black with gold etching — and marched to the base of the Star.

“No!” Liora screamed.

Mariun raised the staff high above his head—

—and *slammed* it into the Star’s core.

A sound like splitting sky.

A shockwave blasted outward in every direction.

The Star cracked again—

—and everything went white.
