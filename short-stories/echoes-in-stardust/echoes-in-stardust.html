			<pre>
In a medieval town bound by tradition, it is custom for children deemed “cursed” 
to be taken to a celestial relic — the Star — to be “cleansed.” But when a mother’s 
child begins to see their so-called curse as a blessing, she starts to question everything. 
As she uncovers the dark truth behind the Star, she must risk everything — even her life — 
to protect her child’s individuality and awaken a town lost to conformity. 

What she thought was salvation turns out to be a prison for an angel of freedom… 
and only rebellion can bring back the light.
