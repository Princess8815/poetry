                ✨ Echoes in Stardust – Comming May 🌌

                > In a town ruled by silence,
                difference is a curse...
                and the cure steals more than it gives.
                
                Every summer, children who are “marked” are taken deep into the forest…
                to a sacred Star that promises to make them whole.
                
                But when twelve-year-old Elowen begins to see beauty in what others call broken,
                her mother, Liora, must make an impossible choice:
                
                Follow the ritual…
                or protect her child’s voice — before it’s taken forever.
                
                As the truth behind the Star unravels,
                a hidden angel begins to stir…
                and the fate of individuality itself hangs in the balance.
