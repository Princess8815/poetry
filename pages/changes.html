				<strong>⚙️ Major Site Overhaul:</strong><br>
				<span style="font-size: 1.1em;">
				🚧 <em>Princess Poetry & Stories</em> has undergone a <strong>massive infrastructure update</strong>!
				</span>
				<br><br>
				hotfix
				🌸 The site is now <strong>easier than ever to update and expand</strong>, allowing faster addition of new poems and stories.<br>
				🔗 However, this change has <strong>restructured internal URLs</strong> — meaning <em>older direct links to individual poems may no longer work.</em><br><br>
				✨ This upgrade paves the way for smoother content creation and future features across the <em>Poetry</em> and <em>Short Stories</em> collections.

                ✨ Echoes in Stardust – Comming May 🌌

                > In a town ruled by silence,
                difference is a curse...
                and the cure steals more than it gives.
                
                Every summer, children who are “marked” are taken deep into the forest…
                to a sacred Star that promises to make them whole.
                
                But when twelve-year-old Elowen begins to see beauty in what others call broken,
                her mother, Liora, must make an impossible choice:
                
                Follow the ritual…
                or protect her child’s voice — before it’s taken forever.
                
                As the truth behind the Star unravels,
                a hidden angel begins to stir…
                and the fate of individuality itself hangs in the balance.
                
                ---
                
                > 🌠 Some lights were never meant to be silenced.
                Coming soon: Echoes in Stardust
                📖 Over 30 emotionally powerful scenes
                🕯️ A story of rebellion, love, and the voice within
